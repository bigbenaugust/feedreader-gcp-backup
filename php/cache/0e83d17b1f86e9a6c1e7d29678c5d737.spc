This is no surprise that the number of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38026625">people using a bike to get around is increasing</a>, after all, it is the safest way to travel and has a variety of health benefits, and that isn’t even mentioning that you’re saving the world by doing so. But, which gadgets on the market should you test out on your next commute?</p>
<p><strong>Revolights Bicycle Lighting</strong></p>
<p>This ingenious piece of technology is one of the best gadgets on the market, and not only does it add a layer of style to your bike but also increases the security. The LED ring on the bike wheels light up as you pedal and the wheels are spinning. This ensures that others can see you when you are on the road and also so that you can easily see around your surroundings in the dark. Not done there, it is also complete with the ability to change color when you slow down and when you’re turning direction.</p>
<p><strong>Zackees Turn Signal Gloves</strong></p>
<p>You no longer need to <a href="https://www.novibet.co.uk/sports">bet</a> on the people around you, seeing your hand action. Instead, this clever piece of kits allows people around you to easily see that you’re turning as your gloves light up announcing that you’re doing so. The kit is made up with Lycra Spandex with leather palms, and 54 LED arrow-shaped signs form the lights. The gloves are battery powered and are censored so that they are brighter in the daylight hours to extend battery life. This piece of kit is a must-have for all commuters.</p>
<p><strong>GoPro Hero5</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re an adventurous biker or just use the bike to get to and from work, this GoPro could be a lifesaver in both circumstances. It is the perfect way to capture your journey, and the size of the device means that it can easily attach to your big. The environment that it is in makes no difference as it is built to operate in even the worst of conditions. It is weather-resistant and can capture footage in 1080p, and is incredibly affordable. For commuters, it is also a handy piece of kit if there are dangerous drivers on the road that could cause an accident for fellow bikers.</p>
<p><strong>ICEdot Crash Sensor</strong></p>
<p>It is always wise to prepare for the worst, and this piece of kits takes care of all those worries for you. The simple small device can be attached to your helmet, and it will detect if the wearer has crashed. At first, it will set off an alarm on your phone, and should that not be deactivated then an automatic location is sent to an emergency contact. The batteries in the device are rechargeable and typically last for 20 hours. It is a smart gadget that is good for even the most unlikely of circumstances.</p>

<p>Apart from being a sports activity, riding a bicycle is considered one of the safest means of getting around in the current world. When you think about the health benefits that come with cycling, a bike is not only safe, but the healthiest and the most enjoyable mode of transportation we have around. However, it is undeniable that when you share the roads with vehicles it can also be dangerous too.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fmHAZw5s0q3-Y4jNtbzhks37jSZuReGMggyguEPglM9HEFzJQt2c4AJkPHKwOfe1oZqhJ4Uko4-cHwthtlQ_vJUctRU9WzuSNj1HR9Essk4i2cgQqKiQeswEcPigdxZ6mfz7TCN3" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Because of this, this article will introduce basic rules and safety tips that will keep you from any harm both on and off the roads.</p>



<h2>Be conversant with the bikers rules whilst on the road</h2>



<p>Bikes are considered vehicles in almost every state if not all. Just like a truck and car owner, cyclists have to follow a set of stipulated rules while on the roads. The best place to ride a bike is on the streets. Children under 10 years are however required to ride with their parents on the sidewalks.<br></p>



<p>While riding on the streets, ride on the right following the traffic—go with the traffic flow, not against it. Otherwise, you would be <a href="https://www.personalinjurylawcal.com/tracy-personal-injury-lawyer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="risking a crash (opens in a new tab)">risking a crash</a> or traffic offense ticket.</p>



<h2>Check your helmet</h2>



<p><a href="https://greatist.com/fitness/bicycle-safety-101#1">Before you hop on your bike</a>, give it a quick once over to see if all the components are as they are supposed to be. When you&#8217;re satisfied, check your helmet for imperfections too. A cracked helmet will be of little use if you have a bicycle accident. According to NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety-Administration), you&#8217;re always required to put on a perfectly fitting helmet every time you hit the road.<br></p>



<p>When purchasing a new helmet, check the sticker that it has met the safety certification from the US Consumer Product-Safety Commission; this guarantees the helmet has passed all the necessary tests and is good to be used.</p>



<h2>Be extra careful at intersections</h2>



<p>According to a survey, about half of all bicycle crashes occur at junctions and intersection points. Apart from obeying traffic signals, scan for cyclists or traffic around you. Prior to any turn or change in direction, check for traffic break behind you, position yourself in the right lane, then give a signal which direction you want to go.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oHmxkhPmP1Q6iYnRv8m3Wt6W4odZDNk3MuKzsHwcObJBRyjr8JDMcyyfocz5pB4PJgzNBVpuWvGTtgpKuIrsSXpiXZbU7INfiEPUmI6gMMNF14QZxkB6X4iQFTxYhi2GlWLi8dfD" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The proper sequence will require you to look, signal then look. <a href="https://www.ilovebicycling.com/cycling-hand-signals/">Hand signals are the best</a> to let other cyclists or drivers know where you are going next. Make eye contact and be always on the lookout &#8211; don&#8217;t assume they will stop!</p>



<h2>Stay visible</h2>



<p>This applies especially when biking in poorly lit streets or at night. When other drivers cannot see you, chances are, they are more likely to hit you. Ensure your bike is equipped with a proper lighting system. To add to this, put on reflectors which act as additional safety features.</p>



<h2>Cycling under the influence of drugs and alcohol</h2>



<p>A report released by NHTSA showed that 1 out of every 3 fatalities related to cyclists were as a result of drunk bicycling. <a href="https://www.citywidelaw.com/bike-accidents-on-the-rise-as-young-people-opt-for-alternative-transportation/">Bicycle accidents are on the rise</a> but the saddening fact is that the resulting factors can easily be avoided. Since people offer limited protection, it&#8217;s always advisable not to take a ride when intoxicated. There is no excuse for other drivers too, and one is fully accountable when caught drunk driving.<br></p>



<p>It is also advisable you avoid busy streets, cities and crowded tourist destinations as the large number of people increases the probability of having an accident. Parents should always be on the lookout-ensuring their kids are following the traffic rules as often later at night there is a bigger risk of cyclists being under the influence of something.</p>



<h2>Avoid distraction</h2>



<p>When riding a bike, you need to have maximum concentration which will help you be in control at all times and sprung into action if need be. Don&#8217;t get distracted or be over-ambitious while riding on the roads. Avoid putting earphones on, listening to music or picking up calls while riding.<br></p>



<p>When passing other bicyclists or pedestrians, warn them that you are approaching with a bell or shouts, for instance &#8216;on your left!&#8217;.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Check your bicycle to make sure</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The tires are properly inflated.</li><li>The brakes are perfect and the grip is enough.</li><li>The chain is properly oiled and is moving smoothly.</li><li>All the nuts and bolts are perfectly tightened.</li><li>Take a pressure pump with you if you are planning to cover a considerable distance.</li></ul>



<h2>Be aware of parked vehicles</h2>



<p>Parked vehicles are far more dangerous than the ones on the move. Ride at safe distances of about 4 feet (1.22 m) to avoid being hit by doors that are opened suddenly.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ESbL7synItep2KRcc0Dq0cdi5x60UBzaeEHlfWjMysprP4jHmdTxc2qLS5n4BrnK37PLTQ7lLwYF2FzHnsj3WKQrsubYd9AUg4YTq4KocdJYtyCOVtwX-elvlhyyDfyv2CPFv0yr" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In an effort to reduce carbon print, most people are ditching traditional modes of transport in favor of bicycles which are more Eco-friendly. However, due to poor planning and lack of adequate infrastructure, most bicyclists are getting injured and killed in traffic accidents. However, following the simple instructions like not wearing headsets and being on the lookout will always keep you safe.</p>



<h2><strong>Speeding on Pedestrian Zones</strong></h2>



<p>More often, cyclists attach power meters to their bikes to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://powermetercity.com/product/powerpod-power-meter/" target="_blank">gauge power&nbsp;output</a>. We understand the need for it, especially when training for an upcoming race. But a busy pedestrian street is not the right area to train how fast and how far you can go. For the pedestrian&#8217;s safety as well as your own, always know your limits and mind your speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h1>We generally accept that it is simply good sense for mountain bikers and competitive cyclists to carry a basic first aid kit attached to their bike frames. But what about commuters? </h1>



<p> Do people whose primary cycling activity is commuting on a daily basis really need to have a first aid kit on hand? No. No one absolutely has to carry a first aid kit. But it is still the smart thing to do.</p>



<p>Accidents do happen. Bike commuters hit
the streets every single day just assuming they will get where they are going
safely. Most do, but most are not equal to all. Every single day cyclists are
injured on their way to wherever. Those whose bikes are equipped with basic
first aid kits tend to be better prepared when those injuries do occur.</p>



<h2>What Is in a Good First Aid Kit?</h2>



<p>Assembling a good first aid kit is not hard.
If you don&#8217;t want to do one yourself, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.seton.co.uk/first-aid-supplies/first-aid-kits">top-rated UK approved first aid kits</a> available
for sale online. The point is to buy a kit you always take with you on your
bike. A good first aid kit contains the following:</p>



<ul><li>Wound pads</li><li>First-aid packets</li><li>Gauze bandages</li><li>Adhesive bandages</li><li>Plaster strips</li><li>Tube bandages</li><li>Dressing bandages</li><li>Tweezers and scissors</li><li>Rescue blanket.</li></ul>



<p>A first aid kit is not meant to carry
everything you might need to handle a serious trauma incident. First aid
supplies are intended to temporarily treat things like abrasions, lacerations,
insect bites, and broken bones.</p>



<h2>What Should the Carrying Case Look Like?</h2>



<p>You are going to need something to carry all
of your first aid supplies in. Perhaps the best way to go is a waterproof nylon
or canvas bag. Both materials will do an adequate job of protecting your
supplies while still remaining fairly lightweight and flexible.</p>



<p>If nylon or canvas is not your thing,
consider parachute fabric or even a hard-plastic shell. Whatever you choose, it
is going to have to be mounted on your bike frame with some sort of bracket or
hooks. Keep that in mind as you shop around.</p>



<h2>Does It Have To Be Waterproof?</h2>



<p>It is not absolutely necessary that your
first aid bag be waterproof, but why would you choose something that isn&#8217;t?
Using a bag that is not waterproof is just inviting trouble. A heavy rain
shower could soak all of your bandages and render them useless. Water inside
your first aid kit could cause scissors and tweezers to rust. Nothing good can
come of choosing a bag that isn&#8217;t waterproof.</p>



<h2>Why the Rescue Blanket?</h2>



<p>Nearly every commercially available first
aid kit includes a rescue blanket that may appear as nothing more than a thin
piece of fabric covered with aluminium foil. Also known as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9325662">space
blankets</a> due to their association with space travel, rescue blankets
serve a vital purpose in first aid scenarios. It is all about something known
as shock.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of an accident – even a
minor accident – the body can go into shock. The medical condition known as
shock is one in which the body attempts to preserve internal organs by reducing
blood flow to the skin. This is not good in that it prevents the body from
maintaining its proper temperature.</p>



<p>A rescue blanket helps keep an injured
person warm. As such, it is a life-saving piece of kit that should be in every
first aid bag.</p>



<h2>How Often Should My Kit Be Restocked?</h2>



<p>You may put together a bike commuter&#8217;s
first aid kit and never use it. Hopefully, that&#8217;s the case. It is better to
spend money on first aid supplies you will never use than to be caught
unprepared without them. At any rate, your kit should be restocked every time
you use it. You should also check your supplies every few months to ensure
their integrity. Any items that no longer appear up to the task should be
replaced.</p>



<h2>Is There Anything Else I Need to Know?</h2>



<p>Keeping a basic first aid kit on board
your bike is a smart idea. If you do not mind adding a little bit of extra
weight, consider stocking your kit with a few additional items not listed here.
These might include splints, eye wash, burn cream, and an antibiotic ointment.
The more prepared you are, the more effective your first aid kit will be.</p>



<p>One last thing to note is that it&#8217;s wise
to have a basic understanding of <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/firindex.htm">first
aid procedures</a>. In other words, knowing how to use your kit
appropriately is smart. You can take first aid classes in your local community,
perhaps even free of charge in some cases. The combination of the right first
aid supplies and a solid understanding of first aid procedures could someday
prove invaluable.</p>

<p>Riding a bike is referenced as an example in a saying that signifies skills you don’t forget once you’ve learned – it is that popular. Riding a bike is an amazing way to get places… it’s a great workout; easy to park and go; cheaper than most other forms of transportation; and let’s face it, way more fun than riding the bus. It is also perfect for the environment as no exhaust is involved!</p>
<p>With the advances we see every day with every little item we use in our lives, bikes are no exception.<b> Innovation never sleeps, and in this article we will take a look at some of the most advances biking technologies that are being developed right now.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21402" src="http://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bc1.jpg" alt="bikecommuters.com" width="586" height="440" srcset="https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bc1.jpg 586w, https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bc1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" /></p>
<h2>Smart bikes</h2>
<p>With the reign of electric and solar cars, smart bicycles are also becoming a thing of the now. Smart bikes or e-bikes might look like regular bicycles, but they come with a small electric engine powered by a rechargeable battery. In addition to the convenience of getting a muscle and cardio workout on the go, <a href="https://www.wheelbase.co.uk/blog/ebikes-can-improve-fitness/">commuting with electric bikes</a> is made even more convenient as many models now come with features that allow for smartphone integration.</p>
<h2>E-bike locks</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2026986/gear-you-need-prevent-your-bike-ever-being-stolen">Landing the perfect lock</a> to go with your trusty bicycle can be tricky, since there are loads to choose from. Needless to say, making the wrong lock decision can have some awful consequences. You will want to pick a lock (pun intended) that’s both secure enough to protect your bike, and easy enough to use on a daily basis. With smart bikes on the market, we now observe innovation in locks, away from the standard bike lock with heavy chains and clumsy designs. The market now offers futuristic locks operated through protected wireless features; a point for ease, efficiency and security.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21403" src="http://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bc2.jpg" alt="e-bike locks" width="541" height="360" srcset="https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bc2.jpg 541w, https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bc2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<h2>Anti-theft features</h2>
<p>In addition to e-locks, bikes today come complete with various anti-theft features for your peace of mind. From sirens and alarms to theft indicator maps, your security options are anything but scarce. And with the ongoing advancements in the realm of digital features, bikes just get smarter; many smart bikes today are equipped with GPS or other forms of invisible tracking devices for theft incidents.</p>
<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect bike with the right frame size is a dream come true; not only are bikes available in different shapes and sizes, but many manufacturers now offer a customization service for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2011/06/23/why-you-need-a-custom-road-bike-2/#66a715da3ce8">the perfect biking experience</a>. We seem to live in a brave new world of frame design, and the industry is booming as bike builders are creating custom rides to fit their clients&#8217; preferences, needs, and body types.</p>
<p>Choosing a bicycle for transportation is a great idea for many reasons; fitness, cost, convenience, and the planet! But before you make your purchase, you must identify your individual needs and what you want out of your bike. Industry innovations offers a plenty of options to choose from, from smart bikes to advanced security features and customization. Choosing your next bike may not be as simple as it was in the past, but if the your requirements are met, it will make your life that much easier for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Here are a few essential tips for taking care of your bike:</strong></p>
<h2>1. Make sure your tires are properly inflated.</h2>
<p>You should always check your bike&#8217;s tire pressure before and after you ride. If they are not inflated properly, you could risk a puncture or other damage on your ride. Use a tire pump that is compatible with the valve for your bike tires.</p>
<h2>2. Clean your bike.</h2>
<p>You should also make sure to <u><a href="https://www.bicycling.com/repair/g20034545/how-to-clean-your-bike/#sidepanel">clean your bike</a></u> on a regular basis. Take the time to remove any leaves, mud or other debris from the tires and bike surfaces. It just takes a few minutes of scrubbing with a gentle brush or sponge and some soapy water. Wipe your tires carefully with a soft cloth. You can use a brush to clean the chain and cogs, and apply a degreaser to the cogs to keep them in peak condition.</p>
<h2>3. Check your brakes.</h2>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to check your bike&#8217;s brakes at least once a month, depending on use. Clean the brakes regularly to avoid squeaks. Examine the brake pads for wear and replace them when necessary. Check the brake handle clamp to make sure it&#8217;s not loose. Test the cables by squeezing the brake handles. You can tighten the brake level barrel if adjustments are required.</p>
<h2>4. Lubricate your bike chains, pedals and assemblies.</h2>
<p>Lubricating essential bike parts helps it function better and last longer. You should take the time to regularly lubricate your bike chains, brake assemblies, pedals and brake and shifter levels on a regular basis. This helps prevent rust and corrosion. When finished, wipe off these surfaces with a clean cloth to remove dirt and excess lubrication.</p>

<h2>5. Examine the tires and wheel bearings.</h2>
<p>One of the last maintenance checks you should perform is making sure that your wheel bearings and tires are straight and even. Put your bike on a stand and mount and spin the wheels a few times to see how they move. If they spin unevenly, they may need to be adjusted or straightened. If this is the case, you may want to bring your bike to the repair shop so that experts can fix the problem for you.</p>

<p class="c1">Are you interested in <span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.goingzerowaste.com/blog/5-ways-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint">reducing your carbon footprint</a></span><span class="c0"> while also becoming healthier and more energized? If so, then biking to work is right for you. These are nine facts about biking to work that will motivate you today. </span></p>
<h2 id="h.xejgdvlu5jyk" class="c2"><span class="c3">1. Cost-effective </span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how good the gas prices are, they have nothing on the price of fueling a bike, which is, quite literally, nothing. Even if you still use your car for things like grocery trips, you can reduce your expenses considerably by riding a bike. You may marvel at how much you end up saving. </span></p>
<h2 id="h.5innfzhdpjyc" class="c2"><span class="c3">2. Traffic reduction </span></h2>
<p class="c1">Conventional wisdom would tell that biking takes longer than driving. While you might not be able to cruise down the highway at 80 miles per hour, you can also avoid traffic congestion and the frustration that comes with it. It&#8217;s even better if you&#8217;re in a city with <span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="http://spacestoplaces.blogs.realtor.org/2017/01/11/bike-lanes-build-them-and-they-will-come/">designated bike lanes</a></span><span class="c0">.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 id="h.1wa6qw430bki" class="c2"><span class="c3">3. Elevated mood </span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Biking is more than a commute. It&#8217;s also a way to improve your outlook. Exercise brings us increased endorphins and this is a great starting point.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 id="h.44tq4pgrm0r" class="c2"><span class="c3">4. Get in shape </span></h2>
<p class="c1">Have you been looking to improve your physique but think that you don&#8217;t have the time? Well, you won&#8217;t have any excuses when you&#8217;re riding a bike to work. Commuting and exercising can be combined in one. Even if you <span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.ecosecretariat.org">work for yourself</a></span><span class="c0">, you can take morning bike rides.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 id="h.coiuwdqo6n9n" class="c2"><span class="c3">5. Safe from fumes </span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sitting in a car can expose you to all kinds of exhaust. Being in an automobile can expose you to these chemicals much more than on a bike. Having fresh air is nothing to sneeze at.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 id="h.ymel0plvzmm8" class="c2"><span class="c3">6. Help the environment </span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All those cars are the road is not good for the environment. Riding a bike can help the environment by reducing pollution. We only have one planet, and we want to do good by it.<br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<h2 id="h.8rag2hn8ot4c" class="c2"><span class="c3">8. Improved immune system </span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2017/04/25/new-research-indicates-cycling-to-work-has-extraordinary-health-benefits/#1f86a6673e62">Biking to work makes you healthier</a></span><span class="c0">, which means that you&#8217;ll have fewer sick days. Your employer will appreciate this. They&#8217;ll also appreciate your added energy and brainpower from biking to work.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 id="h.2rba9xy4tqmf" class="c2"><span class="c3">9. Inspire others </span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to make a difference in the world, this can be your start. It might seem like a small gesture, but you could end up inspiring co-workers, family members, and friends. You can be a catalyst for all kinds of people deciding to bike to work.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing what a difference getting on a bike on your way to work can make. Instead of feeling cooped up inside of a car or bus, you can feel all the freer.

<p>It is perfectly normal to walk into a bike store and be mesmerized by those electric yellow speed bikes or black and red road bikes; it is also perfectly normal to immediately forget about them once you see their prices. Sure, there are a lot of cool looking bikes, but at the end of the day, they will only make you look dope while riding them- that is the only thing that they’re good for, and the companies that are selling them knows that and they sell them based on the “cool” factor only. So if you’re looking for a legit road bike that is both self-reliant and affordable, here are some<a href="https://www.activeweekender.com/cheap-road-bikes/"> recommendations from Active Weekender</a>.</p>
<p><b>Which Type of Bike Suits You?</b></p>
<p>Before going on an exploration trip to find the right bike for you, you need to know exactly what you want to do with your bike. Coming to terms with your decision will affect your budget. How much you are willing to spend on your future bike will solely depend on deciding on a certain type. If you’re a casual rider then aim for cursing bikes, since they are very affordable and come in an affordable quality material.</p>
<p>Usually cruising and training bikes don’t cost much, unless they come with extra components. Stray away from expensive brand bikes, and mountain bikes if you are only looking for a casual ride. Mountain bikes are usually expensive, so the only thing that will be budget-friendly in this case is to find affordable mountain bike materials like carbon fiber. Brand bikes tend to be more specialized and you don’t really need that if you’re looking for a smooth cruise.</p>
<p><b>Frames</b></p>
<p>If you’re essentially looking for a smooth ride then look for materials like aluminum-frame road bikes, since they are the most affordable material out of titanium, carbon fiber and steel, they also come with a carbon fiber front fork that take in any kind of vibration so that you can enjoy a smooth ride around the town.</p>
<p>Now you need to understand that your budget-friendly bike absolutely depends on what you’re looking for in a bike, so if you’re looking for longevity, lightness, and durability then go for titanium-frame road bike, but the only set back is that it is a little costly. If you’re looking for strong, light material then head for a carbon-fiber-road bike, and if you’re looking for a bike to enjoy slow rides then aim for steel-frame road bikes, steel bikes are known to be beautiful anyway, so enjoy the ride on your pretty bike!</p>
<p><b>Your Bike</b></p>
<p>Buying a bike is supposed to be fun, so just familiarize yourself with your needs, style, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2014/apr/11/10-reasons-hopping-on-your-bike-is-the-best-thing-ever">enjoy the ride</a> on your brand new bike! You’ll be much better equipped now that you have the basic knowledge of what matters on you.</p>

Why not ask her out on a bicycle date? We guarantee, your darling will definitely be amazed!</p>
<p>There’s an opinion that a romantic date is the one which takes place in a luxurious cafe, but today, this approach outlived its usefulness. You have more chances to amaze your partner if you plan an unconventional date, but how to do this? We highly encourage you to take your <u><a href="https://momentummag.com/ten-fun-bicycle-date-ideas/">girlfriend out on a bicycle date</a></u>, but before you do this, you should make sure that she can ride a bicycle. Check the main reasons why you should do this!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It’s so romantic!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>However, you should plan your date in advance. Firstly, you need to plan the route and decide where you go beforehand. Are there any romantic places in your city? Maybe you want to go to the country? You should always have a route in your mind or in your smartphone!</p>
<p>Simply put, you will spend the whole day outdoors and get to know each other better!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>It is free of charge!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You might know that sometimes, a date costs too much. However, not every student can afford to meet a bill in an expensive restaurant. If you already have a bike or even two, it is not a problem to take your girlfriend out on a bicycle date. Even if you don’t have bicycles, you can rent them. You won’t pay too much! Besides, you can throw a small party in the countryside. When you <u><a href="https://casanovastyle.com/">date a college girl </a></u>and want to surprise her, a bicycle date is the best solution!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>There are no rules which you should follow</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Just imagine the situation. You decided to go out to see a <u><a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/best-date-movies/ranker-film">movie for a date</a></u>. It means that there is a certain timeline, and you simply can’t go earlier. Sometimes, it happens that there’s nothing to talk about. You don’t like each other, and you wish to go away, but you can’t do that because you are stuck in a certain timeline.</p>
<p>The situation is absolutely different when you are on a bicycle ride. If you feel like you don’t like each other, you can ride your own way. There’s no need to depend on a certain timetable. You are free to do what you want!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>You’ll get to know each other better</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Hackneyed dates aren’t popular anymore! You meet each other, have dinner together, and go away. Simply put, you can’t get to know each other better. When you are on a bicycle ride, the situation is absolutely different. You never know what will happen in an hour or two. You may lose your way, fall down, or even injure yourself! As a result, you’ll see how your partner behaves in this or that situation. You’ll see whether your girlfriend wants to help you find the solution or she just blows your mind! A bicycle ride is a fair opportunity to check whether <u><a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/how-to-know-you-and-your-partner-are-a-good-match2017-9">you are a good match</a></u> with your partner.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>You’ll talk a lot</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If it is a problem for you to mix well with people, a bicycle date is a fair opportunity to change the situation for the better and overcome your fear. When you are on a ride, in all likelihood, you will be discussing different topics, landscapes, etc. Sooner or later, you will stop and have a break, grabbing a drink along the way. When you do something together, you will always have what to talk about. Besides, you are building up chemistry by talking to each other! It is so easy to keep the conversation going. Even if it seems like you can’t find common topics, you can always discuss things you see around &#8211; a nice landscape, sunny weather, delicious cake, or flavourous coffee!</p>
<p>Well, if you don’t have the slightest idea how to make your girlfriend happy, you should take her out on a bicycle date. Keep in mind that girls like guys who think outside the box! She will bear in mind this day for a long time!</p>

In 1769, mankind witnessed the invention of the first steam-powered automobile by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. And only after 48 years, we adopted a new transportation tool &#8211; a bicycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some time bicycles lost their popularity and were considered as children&#8217;s transportation mean. <a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2016/05/19/10-reasons-start-cycling-kids/">Kids love cycling because it&#8217;s fun</a>, they spend their energy, they move around, they are active and feel great after a short cycling session. We basically pointed out all the benefits to biking, but there&#8217;s more to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>It&#8217;s more fun!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biking is simply a fun activity. It&#8217;s correlated with childhood memories and games. You could still have fun while biking as an adult. You get to observe the streets you pass by, hear the daily sounds, encounter animals and birds, and integrate with nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children love observing their surroundings. To have more fun you need to keep your inner child and find happiness in the simplest things.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21353" src="http://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bike1.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="410" srcset="https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bike1.jpg 627w, https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bike1-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>It&#8217;s practically a workout</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biking to work is good for your physical health. First of all, you are saving money on your gym membership. Secondly, you are getting in shape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if biking is a simple cardio and leg workout, and doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ll build your ideal body, it&#8217;s still a healthy way of transportation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biking burns a lot of calories and prepares your heart for other cardio exercises in the future. You can, of course, start jogging to burn calories and fat, but biking is better for your joints too. By biking every day to work, you can improve your cardiovascular fitness, lower the blood pressure and boost energy. You will be able to build a stronger muscle tissue and improve coordination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it dreamy? To have a practical and beneficial transport all in one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You get to save your money on transportation</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buy a bicycle once and stop worrying about your transportation costs. Leave the worrying to personal car drivers. The gas price keeps rising, and driver&#8217;s wallets keep thinning. On average, people spend half of their salaries on gas money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public transport users are also in a bad image when it comes to saving money. Yes, it&#8217;s better to travel by public transport, but you still need to pay money for the services and keep up with other people too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s carpooling, but it&#8217;s for another cause. You could still look up <a href="https://blog.taxact.com/how-to-save-from-carpooling-benefits/">carpooling benefits</a> and see how you&#8217;d like to share the cost of transportation.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21354 alignright" src="http://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bike2.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="414" srcset="https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bike2.jpg 626w, https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bike2-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You get to save your money on repairs</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average cost of maintaining a car in a good condition is between 9000 &#8211; 10 000 US dollar a year. And it differs from men to men. Bike owners only spend 300 &#8211; 500 US dollars a year to maintain their bike&#8217;s good condition. Not to mention the huge difference between a car and bike repair costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enjoy the outdoors &amp; get to know your community</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are biking to and from work you find opportunities to enjoy the commute more by <a href="https://rvingreviews.com/best-time-to-see-the-fall-folliage/">seeing the changing of the seasons</a> or finding pop community events happening. These unplanned perks can help you actually look forward to commuting each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Losing weights and becoming fitter</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We already mentioned that biking to work is good for your fitness activities. But what about those people who want to lose weight and get in shape? Most people don&#8217;t have time to visit the gym daily or at least three times a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biking to work every day is a great substitute for an hour on a treadmill. Biking will help you lose some weight and become fitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Avoiding traffic jams</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more pleasing to hear than this? While cars and buses stay in the traffic jams on busy hours, you can safely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2014/apr/11/10-reasons-hopping-on-your-bike-is-the-best-thing-ever">drive on bike lanes and go home in time</a>. Car drivers will envy you for such flexibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What else is there to tell you that will help you decide to try biking to work? You&#8217;ll be able to experience all the benefits and advantages of biking while going to work.</p>

<p>Every brand’s success story is viewed from two perspectives –</p>
<ol>
<li>How they handled stepping stones, what innovative ideas they brought in the market, and the secret ingredient that keeps them afloat amidst all the competition.</li>
<li>How the team handled stepping stones, how the team worked on creating innovative ideas, and the secret ingredient to team spirit that keeps them afloat amidst all the competition.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is clear that while the world views success as a series of accomplishments, a business owner knows it is all about the team. It is not possible to become a brand without a successful team backing you up at every point.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-top-10-reasons-startups-fail-ab3196d70568">why startups fail</a> is due to the wrong team. Your team shouldn’t necessarily be a group of highly skilled, all-rounder professionals. However, they should definitely fit together like a jigsaw puzzle where one person fills the shortcomings of the other – in order to create a bigger picture.</p>
<p>Here are top 6 ways that will help you put up pieces together perfectly to create the bigger picture –</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1.Hiring process – make or break time</b><br />
Whom you hire decides the future of your startup and how you hire is how you can ensure a good future for your startup! Your hiring process should be crystal clear in your mind and should filter you the candidate that not only meets your requirements but also matches your core values.</p>
<p>Here are certain points that are absolutely necessary for hiring –</p>
<ol>
<li>Break away from the regular and age-old process of hiring, especially if it doesn’t meet your criteria. Figure out what works for you and hire accordingly.</li>
<li>Whom you hire shouldn’t be your sole decision but a team decision. This is especially important for startups.</li>
<li>A resume can be as good or bad as a book cover. You know what they say about judging a book by its cover – never make the same mistake with resumes.</li>
<li>Most importantly, never forget to ask the question – “Are you ready to work in a startup?” A frank answer will save you from troubles later on.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2.It’s time to move ahead of the “cogs in the wheel” ideology</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, how often do you relate happy emotions whenever the idiom “a cog in a wheel” comes to your mind? Yes, it sounds corporative and brings out a certain spirit of discipline, organization, and orientation. However, with employees spending more time at the office than their homes, they need to feel more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkwilliams/2017/05/22/6-ways-to-create-a-supportive-work-environment/#751250f2eafc">work environment</a> that makes employees feel motivated to work and eager to head to the office every day. The work environment differs according to the type of work that goes in the office. However, you can make sure that work never goes off balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3.Recognition matters more than you can imagine</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21392" src="http://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art33.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="501" srcset="https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art33.jpg 672w, https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art33-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p>Whenever your startup successfully achieves a milestone, it’s a matter of pride and happiness. However, it’s not something that is exclusive to an employee. Just the way you want your startup to be recognized, similarly, every employee wants to be recognized for his/her efforts.</p>
<p>Remember, every small thing (<a href="https://vivipins.com/custom-enamel-pins/">maybe a small Employee recognition enamel pins</a>) counts. From verbal appreciation every now and then to giving out the employee of the month, awards on annual parties, and special acknowledgment during completion of projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4.Don’t miss on the fun quotient</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lack of energy and motivation are very common problems in the workplace. Especially in a startup – where you can be faced by difficult challenges at any given point. Startups cannot work according to their schedule; they need to work around their client’s schedule. Hence, too much workload is a common sight at a startup office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beat this gloominess with fun! Incorporate fun in office schedule whenever and wherever possible. From monthly visits to cinemas and local places to yearly trips. Even your daily schedule can have some interesting activities to do. There are many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecomaford/2018/04/07/5-ways-to-have-more-fun-at-work/#747f2a96248f">ways to have more fun at work</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.Hierarchy should not hamper communication    </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21393" src="http://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art44.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="500" srcset="https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art44.jpg 597w, https://www.bikecommuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art44-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p>You’ll be surprised to know what <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/effects-poor-communication-business-345.html">problems</a> can miscommunication cause at a workplace. If we have to name one major reason for miscommunication at a workplace – it has to be hierarchy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hierarchical structure makes people at a certain level unavailable and inaccessible to people at a different level. When employees feel they are unheard, unappreciated, and unduly judged, it affects the whole working system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem can mostly be tackled only in the starting period of the business. Make sure you create a hierarchy that leaves no to minimum space for miscommunication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. Understand how to deal with conflicts</b></p>
<p>What’s worse than a poor sales period for a business? Conflicts within the team. Recovering from a dry period is comparatively easy than recovering from conflicts within team members.</p>
<p>The nature of conflicts can vary from being solely work-based to personal matters. You need to deal with them with precaution, as these matters can easily upset the work environment of a startup in no time.</p>
<p>Clear mind, unbiased perceiving of the matter, and focusing more on resolution than pinning the blame – these are some of the important aspects that every startup should know about <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/303617">how to deal with conflicts</a>.</p>
<h1><b>Secret Ingredient to team spirit</b></h1>
<p>The secret ingredient to team spirit that most successful brands vouch by is – ensuring growth for every team member. As your startup grows, it’s very important that your employees feel they are growing with it too!</p>
<h1><b>Final Words</b><b></b></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your startup’s success story of becoming a brand is not just in your hands but in the hands of your team as well. Remember, no startup was driven to success by a single person. It’s collective efforts that lead to collective results.</p>
