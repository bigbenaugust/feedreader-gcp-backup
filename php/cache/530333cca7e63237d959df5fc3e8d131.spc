<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am going to be a bit selfish here, but I think for good reason! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recently got married (yay) and we wanted to wait a bit to plan our honeymoon; we didn’t want to be planning a wedding AND a trip at the same time. My new bride and I both want to go some place we&#8217;ve never been before. While we think we are set on a destination, there are so many fun options to get there and different things to do; I thought I would try to see if any of you had some swell ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve never done something like this before, so I&#8217;m not sure if it will work. But it can&#8217;t hurt! My idea is to give you all some of my thoughts so far, and see what you think. Maybe I will get 0 comments and be sad, or maybe I will be overwhelmed and no better off, but I am hoping to get a gem or two out of this little experiment! Here we go:</span></p>
<p><span id="more-55727"></span></p>
<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
<li>We plan to spend the majority of our time in Santorini, Greece. It&#8217;s place she has wanted to visit and neither of us have been.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not fans of places with a million tourists.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being native Washingtonians, we don’t like hot weather.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shooting for late April to mid May, but would do late September to early October if needed. </span></li>
<li>Wanting to do about 10 days total, but would expand up to 14, if it made sense.</li>
<li>Being this is our honeymoon, we are cool spending a bit more on where we stay, the food, etc, if it has a good ROIOF (return of investment on fun &#8212; acronyms are fun!). Obviously we have a reasonable budget, but I don&#8217;t want it to hold back any ideas.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_55737" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/airport.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55737" class="size-medium wp-image-55737" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/airport-754x251.jpg" alt="" width="754" height="251" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/airport-754x251.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/airport-250x83.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/airport-768x256.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55737" class="wp-caption-text">There is the Santorini Airport &#8211; Photo: <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/104082864@N04/">Andres Alvarado</a> | FlickrCC</p></div>
<h2>Getting to/from Santorini</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will be departing out of Seattle. Unless it is a big enough difference, we don&#8217;t really want to go to YVR or PDX. <i style="font-weight: 400;">(Editor&#8217;s note: </i><i>what</i><i style="font-weight: 400;"> about PAE?)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting there, I am looking at getting creative. Maybe do something like flying into London, Paris, or Rome and take trains/ferries down to Athens for the final ferry to Santorini? Maybe stop for a night once or twice on the way down? Been reading up on options, but wonder if it would be more of a pain than it is worth. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming back, I think we would just want to fly as quick and cheap as possible, but not more than 18 hours for a total trip. Looks like some airlines like Condor and Norwegian have options, but not every day, so need to play with dates. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after 10 years of writing this site, I am still a miles noob. As I write this I have 35,000 Alaska miles. After a basic search, that can get me a one-way ticket to LHR or FRA. Not a requirement to use, but that would save a few $. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we have our miles with Alaska, it would be nice to earn miles with them on tickets that we pay for. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My awesome wife is game for me doing a story or two out of our adventures, so if there is a unique airline/aircraft type or if I can pitch an airline for a story/experience, that is a bonus. That said, she wouldn&#8217;t be game taking 36hrs, flying the wrong way across the globe to try a bunch of different airlines.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>While we are in Santorini</h2>
<ul>
<li>I end up spending more time figuring out how to get to/from a place, the flights, the boats, the trains, etc., and sometimes I forget about planning what to do once I arrive. Guessing maybe some of you can relate? I normally like to have some ideas of things to do, but not all the days scheduled.</li>
<li>Once there, I&#8217;m looking at probably renting a car. Looks like there are taxis and buses, but not the best, plus we always have fun adventures with driving around on our trips.</li>
<li>Looking at things like boat or jetski tour, the hot springs, taking the car to explore the island, relaxing.</li>
<li>Want to stay on the Caldera side. Guessing a few nights in one of the nice hotels with amazing views, and a few in a more reasonably priced hotel. Just depends.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so this ended up being longer than I expected, but there are a lot of moving pieces. Please leave your suggestions/questions in the comments and let’s see what happens. Thank you!</span></p>

At the time, the offering deserved every bit of praise given. But over the past nearly six years, the IFE space has changed a great deal. As a continued frequent Southwest Airlines flyer, when I use their IFE (and in-flight connectivity, IFC) I can't help but cringe knowing my old review is still out there. Alas, my 2014 piece did not age well, on many fronts.</p>
<p>So let's set the record straight: How have Southwest's offerings withstood the test of time?</p>
<p>Southwest Airlines BYOD IFE: In-Flight Connectivity</p>
<p>This piece deals primarily with IFE (in-flight entertainment). Mostly because I have found Global Eagle (the airline's vendor) to be completely inept at delivering a reliable data connection at usable speeds. The only reason I mention the usability of the connection today is that my earlier piece offered it high praise. That documented and very public accolade is something I regret each time I waste $8 on a near-useless all-day flight pass.</p>
<p>Why is the inflight connectivity so bad? Is Global Eagle really as poorly run as I choose to believe they are? Or, perhaps it's because Southwest's top-tier elites receive free internet access, and I typically fly on elite-heavy flights. Of course, complimentary services which rely on data (more on those later) contribute to congestion. The only advice I can offer friends, family, and AR readers alike is this: Do not bother.</p>
<p>In Southwest's defense, they routinely say they are working to better manage their vendor. In late 2018, they suggested that GEE had increased bandwidth allocation by more than seven times. Problem is, the results just aren't there, in my experience. Even if improvements have been made, the airline's decision to give away slices of the small bandwidth pie certainly does not help.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2014/01/a-review-of-southwest-airlines-incredible-bring-your-own-device-in-flight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last looked at</a> the Southwest Airlines BYOD in-flight entertainment (IFE) package back in 2014. At the time, the offering deserved every bit of praise given. But over the past nearly six years, the IFE space has changed a great deal. As a continued frequent Southwest Airlines flyer, when I use their IFE (and in-flight connectivity, IFC) I can&#8217;t help but cringe knowing my old review is still out there. Alas, my 2014 piece did not age well, on many fronts.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s set the record straight: How have Southwest&#8217;s offerings withstood the test of time?</p>
<p><span id="more-55624"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_55629" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2014-08-dump1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55629" class="size-full wp-image-55629" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2014-08-dump1.jpg" alt="An Assortment of Global Eagle Radomes atop Southwest Airlines Planes. - Photos: JL Johnson" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2014-08-dump1.jpg 750w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2014-08-dump1-250x167.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55629" class="wp-caption-text">An assortment of Global Eagle radomes atop Southwest Airlines planes &#8211; Photos: JL Johnson</p></div>
<h3>Southwest Airlines BYOD IFE: In-Flight Connectivity</h3>
<p>This piece deals primarily with IFE (in-flight entertainment). Mostly because I have found Global Eagle (the airline&#8217;s vendor) to be completely inept at delivering a reliable data connection at usable speeds. The only reason I mention the usability of the connection today is that my earlier piece offered it high praise. That documented and very public accolade is something I regret each time I waste $8 on a near-useless all-day flight pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%40southwestair%20wifi&amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why is the inflight connectivity so bad</a>? Is Global Eagle really as poorly run as I choose to believe they are? Or, perhaps it&#8217;s because Southwest&#8217;s top-tier elites receive free internet access, and I typically fly on elite-heavy flights. Of course, complimentary services which rely on data (more on those later) contribute to congestion. The only advice I can offer friends, family, and AR readers alike is this: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Do not bother.</span></p>
<p>In Southwest&#8217;s defense, they routinely say they are working to better manage their vendor. In late 2018, they suggested that GEE had increased bandwidth allocation by more than seven times. Problem is, the results just aren&#8217;t there, in my experience. Even if improvements have been made, the airline&#8217;s decision to give away slices of the small bandwidth pie certainly does not help.</p>

<h3>Free iMessage and WhatsApp access</h3>
<p>In late 2018, Southwest Airlines added free messaging as a unique and much appreciated free service. I take advantage of free messaging on nearly every flight. As long as I keep to text and don&#8217;t try to send photos, it works splendidly. This offering is a real bright spot in the Southwest Airlines BYOD ecosystem.</p>
<p>Protip: Use a long flight to take inventory of your conversations. A random note of appreciation or reply to a long abandoned conversation is sure to delight friends and family.</p>
<div id="attachment_55677" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3283.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55677" class="size-medium wp-image-55677" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3283-754x413.jpg" alt="An assortment of iHeartRadio streaming options by genre." width="754" height="413" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3283-754x413.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3283-250x137.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3283-768x421.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55677" class="wp-caption-text">An assortment of iHeartRadio streaming options by genre</p></div>
<h3>Southwest Airlines BYOD IFE &#8211; Radio, Music, and Podcasts</h3>
<p>In-flight radio, music, and podcasts are provided via a service called iHeartRadio, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications) is the conglomerate behind over 600 local broadcast radio stations. They remain a persistently hopeful player in the crowded streaming market.</p>
<div id="attachment_55678" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3284.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55678" class="wp-image-55678 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3284-250x250.jpg" alt="Some of the iHeartRadio podcasts available for streaming." width="250" height="250" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3284-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3284-754x754.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3284-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55678" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the iHeartRadio podcasts available for streaming.</p></div>
<p>The complimentary on-board iHeartRadio offering is rich, if not overwhelming for its varied options. There are three overarching categories to choose from: A large assortment of radio stations, podcasts, and a feature called Popular Artists by Genre. Streaming of radio stations and podcasts function as one might expect.</p>
<p>If pressed to describe the artists by genre option in one word, I would chose &#8220;inelegant.&#8221; I explored this feature just a few weeks ago. First I selected the dance genre. This presented over a dozen artists to choose from. I chose an artist of familiarity. The service took what felt like a full minute to buffer before playing. After each song there was another long pause, presumably for more buffering.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the songs played were by the artist I had chosen. The rest were a potpourri of others within the same genre. This begs the question; if the reality is more of a genre-level playlist, why bother with a multi-step selection process all the way down to artist?</p>
<p>This iHeartRadio service has promise. I would love to see some of the content stored on-board and thus freed from Global Eagle&#8217;s unreliable and slow data service. Your experience may vary; you should give it a try. Since it&#8217;s free, there is nothing to lose.</p>

No app required.</p></div>
<h3>TV Series Streaming</h3>
<p>TV is where the Southwest Airlines BYOD IFE really begins to shine. The complimentary offering has two segments; Titles available for streaming without the Southwest Airlines app, and those which require the app. At around a dozen options, choices for those without the Southwest app are limited. Thankfully the variety is diverse enough that folks should be able to find something appealing.</p>
<div id="attachment_55676" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3282.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55676" class="size-medium wp-image-55676" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3282-754x449.jpg" alt="A rich assortment of TV streaming options for those who have the Southwest app. " width="754" height="449" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3282-754x449.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3282-250x149.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3282-768x458.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55676" class="wp-caption-text">A rich assortment of TV streaming options for those who have the Southwest app</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s likely safe to assume most passengers have the Southwest app on their phones. The same assumption might not carry to ancillary devices. Let this serve as a reminder to consider adding the app to larger-screened devices as well. Even as a fierce Southwest loyalist, I somehow didn&#8217;t have the app on my iPad. Learn from my mistake! The Southwest app unlocks another dozen or so titles. Items available within this segment have more name recognition and likely a much broader appeal given the number of iconic titles.</p>
<div id="attachment_55680" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3287.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55680" class="wp-image-55680" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3287-566x754.jpg" alt="A snapshot of part of the live TV lineup" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3287-566x754.jpg 566w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3287-188x250.jpg 188w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3287-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3287-754x1005.jpg 754w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55680" class="wp-caption-text">A snapshot of part of the live TV lineup</p></div>
<h3>Free Live TV Streaming</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, there are sixteen TV channels available for free streaming. While I can&#8217;t say I much care for live TV (and its commercials) this seems to be a popular offering on my flights. Given the apparent reliability of the service I assumed Southwest was accessing TV through a second antenna or something independent of their data service. I reached out to Tara Bamburg, Southwest&#8217;s Manager for WiFi and In-flight Entertainment to inquire. She explained that &#8220;we do not have a second antenna just to support live TV, but have instead isolated bandwidth just to support the delivery of live TV to the aircraft. While it does utilize bandwidth, it does not impact what we deliver in terms of connectivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>By isolating a part of the bandwidth for free TV, the airline is able to bolster its entertainment and hopefully distract customers from wanting reliable connectivity. And now that I think of it, it&#8217;s a brilliant strategy. Tara continued, &#8220;these enhancements help keep Customers entertained, which may also make for more bandwidth available to those Customers looking to stay connected and get some work done while traveling.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55674" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3279.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55674" class="size-medium wp-image-55674" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3279-754x377.jpg" alt="A small sampling of the many available on-demand movies." width="754" height="377" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3279-754x377.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3279-250x125.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3279-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55674" class="wp-caption-text">A small sampling of the many available on-demand movies</p></div>
<h3>Free Movies</h3>
<p>Late last year, Southwest announced on-board movies would be available for free. This was a major win for passengers who had grown accustomed to paying $5 per movie. These movies are stored locally on the plane and are not reliant on the data service. As a result, the movies stream quickly and at an appropriate resolution.</p>
<div id="attachment_55672" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0074.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55672" class="size-medium wp-image-55672" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0074-754x415.jpg" alt="Watching Caddyshack at 30K ft.

<p>Free movies is by far the richest entertainment offering in Southwest Airlines BYOD entertainment ecosystem. At last count there were nearly 50 titles available. With options spanning multiple genres and periods, there is truly something for everyone. Alongside new releases are classics like <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and <em>Caddyshack</em>.</p>
<p>Side note: Someone at Southwest Airlines must be a fellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Wilson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebel Wilson</a> fan. I counted at least three of her movies on offer.</p>
<div id="attachment_55673" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_2870.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55673" class="size-medium wp-image-55673" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_2870-754x424.png" alt="Subtitle and language preference are easily accessible and adjustable. " width="754" height="424" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_2870-754x424.png 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_2870-250x141.png 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_2870-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55673" class="wp-caption-text">Subtitle and language preference are easily accessible and adjustable</p></div>
<p>One aspect of on-demand movies which a lot of airlines don&#8217;t get right is the interface. This is another spot where Southwest Airlines BYOD shines. Features such as scrubbing (moving forward or backward) as well as management and adjustment of captions and language preference are implemented well.</p>

<h3>Southwest Airlines BYOD IFE Conclusion</h3>
<p>Southwest&#8217;s IFE has come a long way over the years. Meaningful additions, with free messaging and movies, take the comprehensive package to the next level. These additions also offer a much needed distraction from Southwest&#8217;s perennially bad in-flight connectivity. From what I can tell, the airline recognizes their IFC isn&#8217;t great, and as a result has put a lot of thought and effort into finding new ways to keep folks entertained. It remains to be seen if this will be a viable long-term strategy. But for now, the airline deserves praise for squeezing every byte of data out of Global Eagle while having rich offerings cached on-board to relieve demand for those brave souls who do choose to opt for IFC. Now, if only some of the iHeartRadio content was stored on-board as well&#8230;</p>

<p>If you have been keeping up with the 737 MAX, you know that the news hasn&#8217;t been super great about the aircraft. There are many, many stories you can read out there about what has been going on and we are not wanting to re-hash it all. We can all agree that things are not going well, and it will likely still be a while before anyone has a chance to fly on one (saying that you will want to). Since we are a group of aviation fans that try to celebrate aviation, even in negative times, I decided to just share some really awesome shots of the 737 MAX that our <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/author/francis/">Francis Zera</a> recently took. Feel free to share your thoughts on what is going on with the MAX in the comments; otherwise just enjoy the photos!</p>

<p>I get excited every time a new airline flies out of my hometown airport and I am guessing that you can relate. Especially when it involves an aircraft that is rare for the airport, and it also becomes the longest flight out of the airport. This was the case recently when Singapore Airlines (SQ) started service from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) to Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) using an Airbus A350-900.</p>

<h2>About the SEA-SIN Singapore Airlines Flight</h2>
<p>This is not the longest flight in the world, but at almost 16 hours and 8,070 miles, it isn&#8217;t short. Seattle becomes the fourth US destination (after LAX, EWR, and SFO) to be served by non-stop flights to Singapore. It makes me sort of proud that &#8220;my&#8221; airport is among such great company.</p>

<p>To start, flights out of SEA will operate three times weekly before increasing to four per week in October of this year. Not only is this a nice addition for Singapore into the U.S., but it is also a great international expansion for Sea-Tac Airport. This route is the 12th new international service that has been added since 2017. The airport is now the 10th-most connected international hub in the U.S. and the eighth-most traveled U.S. airport. Sure, that is all great for my flight options, but I will say it makes the airport pretty darn busy!</p>

<p>The flight might be long, but at least you will be rocking it in style in a Singapore Airbus A350. Although I haven&#8217;t flown in one yet, I have flown in an A350 and was quite impressed (<a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2016/03/first-airbus-a350-flight-tam-airlines/">might have said something about it being my new favorite</a>). I also had the opportunity to fly on the world&#8217;s two longest flights with Singapore.</p>
<p>Way back in 2013, <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2013/12/flying-over-21000-miles-to-singapore-in-four-days-who-needs-sleep-part-1/">I got to fly on Singapore&#8217;s A340-500s before they retired them from LAX-SIN-EWR</a>. With the flight times being 18 and 19 hours on those, the 16-hour Seattle flight is cake. Those birds were configured in all business class, with an older product, and if those flights weren&#8217;t so bad, then the new product on the A350 should be a breeze.</p>
<p>You also have a few more class options since this A350-900 is configured with 42 business class, 24 premium economy class and 187 economy class seats (<a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2017/09/singapore-airlines-returns-ultra-long-haul-flying/">SQ has since started service back to LAX and EWR using the A350-900ULR</a>, and that aircraft is configured with just 67 business and 94 premium economy seats). 16 hours in economy might not be a passenger&#8217;s first choice, but I&#8217;d rather do one long flight, versus having two flights with a long, multi-hour layover someplace.</p>

<h3>How to Win the Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 Model?</h3>
<p>Congrats, you made it to the part about winning! It is easy and fun. Just leave a comment on this story sharing what your favorite Singapore Airlines aircraft type is and why (<a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/us/flying-withus/our-story/our-fleet/">if you need help</a>). And yes, you can choose historical planes, cargo, even SilkAir if you want (but I am not sure why you would want to).</p>
<p>At 5:00 pm Seattle time on Wednesday October 2nd, I will close down the comments. I am going to use a random number generator and pick an eligible winner. The contest is open to everyone (except AR writers, or me &#8212; even I am not above the rules). You have to promise to display it, no keeping it in the box to show off to your kids (who likely won&#8217;t care) years down the road &#8212; this baby needs some visual love! One comment per person. You cheat, you are out (and I will likely publicly shame you in some fashion). Good luck!</p>
<p>And if you have some experience with an ultra-long flight&#8230; feel free to share that in the comments as well (but that is more for fun, it won&#8217;t affect the contest).</p>
<p><i>Thank you to Singapore Airlines for providing the model. </i></p>

<p>I would say that is a pretty worthy cause to support this unique livery. This is also special, since it is not actually all paint, but is comprised of the largest decal ever on a composite aircraft.  Boeing has certified the decal technology, so now airline customers can start using them. I am hoping it means more special liveries and please, oh please, I hope it means less European white designs.</p>

<p>I would say that is a pretty worthy cause to support this unique livery. This is also special, since it is not actually all paint, but is comprised of the largest decal ever on a composite aircraft.  Boeing has certified the decal technology, so now airline customers can start using them. I am hoping it means more special liveries and please, oh please, I hope it means less European white designs.</p>

<p>Sure, seeing photos of the plane is nice, but if you live in the Seattle area, <a href="https://www.futureofflight.org/specialty-tours">you can get up close and personal with the 787</a> between now and Sunday (scroll below for more details). You can&#8217;t go inside the plane, but there are not many times a person can walk under a 787 and touch one.</p>

They enable travel at a rate faster and cheaper than at any point in human history, and at an uncompromising level of safety. They enable business and connect us with the world in ways which, just a few generations ago, would have been considered impossible. For some of us, airlines sustain our relationships. AirlineReporter exists because of our collective passion for airlines, travel, and aviation. But being a fan of any particular industry comes with some risk.</p>
<p>Sometimes good companies and organizations do bad things. And when that occurs, it's important to first understand what's happened, and then take action. In a civilized society, we do our best to look past minor disagreements and remain focused on the big picture. But what about egregiously misleading marketing? How does someone who loves the airline industry declare mutiny on one of their trade groups? For months we've pondered this question and have struggled in an identity crisis as a result. So we will do what we do best... we'll cover this conundrum from a unique perspective.</p>
<p>#StopAirTaxNow! Have you seen these ads around social media? In today's crazy political environment, it's just another call-to-action marketing campaign. You know the routine: Trigger folks at the mention of taxes, urge them to phone their elected officials, pick up their pitchforks, and maybe start a revolution. Overreaction? Possibly. But these things are a slippery slope. What sets this campaign apart is that it is funded by airlines we all know and rely on (and sometimes love).</p>

<p>Airlines are AWESOME! They enable travel at a rate faster and cheaper than at any point in human history, and at an uncompromising level of safety. They enable business and connect us with the world in ways which, just a few generations ago, would have been considered impossible. For some of us, <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2017/03/ultra-low-cost-carriers-made-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">airlines sustain our relationships</a>. AirlineReporter exists because of our collective passion for airlines, travel, and aviation. But being a fan of any particular industry comes with some risk.</p>
<p>Sometimes good companies and organizations do bad things. And when that occurs, it&#8217;s important to first understand what&#8217;s happened, and then take action. In a civilized society, we do our best to look past minor disagreements and remain focused on the big picture. But what about egregiously misleading marketing? How does someone who loves the airline industry declare mutiny on one of their trade groups? For months we&#8217;ve pondered this question and have struggled in an identity crisis as a result. So we will do what we do best&#8230; we&#8217;ll cover this conundrum from a unique perspective.</p>

In today&#8217;s crazy political environment, it&#8217;s just another call-to-action marketing campaign. You know the routine: Trigger folks at the mention of taxes, urge them to phone their elected officials, pick up their pitchforks, and maybe start a revolution. Overreaction? Possibly. But these things are a slippery slope. What sets this campaign apart is that it is funded by airlines we all know and rely on (and sometimes love).</p>

<h3>What is Airlines for America?</h3>
<p><a href="http://airlines.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airlines for America</a> (A4A) is an industry trade group which represents most of the major U.S. airlines. <a href="http://airlines.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A4A influences</a> &#8220;on behalf of its members to shape crucial policies and measures&#8230;&#8221; A4A is to airlines what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobacco Institute</a> was for &#8220;big tobacco,&#8221; what the American Medical Association is for doctors, and the Chamber of Commerce is to business. Thinking broadly, these groups are a way for constituents to pool money, share ideas, and ultimately, collectively influence opinion.</p>
<p>Whose opinion are we influencing? Consumers, for sure, but the big money is influencing those in a position to regulate. These consumer-facing calls to action, in fact, urge customers to show their support in a public way which influences elected officials. It turns out the opinion influencing business is a great one to be in. In 2012, NPR&#8217;s Planet Money team <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/06/144737864/forget-stocks-or-bonds-invest-in-a-lobbyist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on</a> a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1375082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> which showed a substantial return on investment for every dollar invested in lobbying. According to the piece: <em>that means for every dollar spent on lobbying, the companies got $220 in [benefits.]</em></p>

<h3>What&#8217;s a PFC?</h3>
<p>A PFC, or Passenger Facility Charge, is what A4A is incorrectly referring to as their so-called &#8220;air tax.&#8221; In fact, PFCs are <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/user-fee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usage fees</a> in that those who use airports pay for them. If you don&#8217;t fly, you don&#8217;t pay. Taxes, on the other hand, are less surgical. My guess is that by intentionally mislabeling this usage fee as a tax, A4A is hoping to successfully kindle the same outrage as when estate taxes were branded by those opposing them as &#8220;death taxes.&#8221; This logic is fundamentally flawed, intentionally deceptive, and throws back to sensationalism in the hopes of reaction.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2015/12/understanding-the-current-debate-over-airport-passenger-facility-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great primer on what PFCs are</a> and how they help airports operate. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from that piece: <em>The PFC is a fee that is automatically applied to the purchase of airfare that airlines collect on behalf of the [airports.] The airlines, in turn, transfer this money over to the airport, minus a small collection fee. [it is variable from airport to airport, but is currently capped at] $4.50 per flight segment, not to exceed $9 for a one-way trip or $18 for round-trip travel. </em>These limits were last adjusted in the year 2000. In the past 19 years, thanks to inflation, the purchasing power of the $4.50 PFC has dropped by at least a third or more by some calculations.</p>

<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
<p>First, we need to address the bad behavior of A4A intentionally misleading consumers. A4A is funded by airlines which in recent years have performed quite well, making record profits. There is no room in public discourse for lobbying firms funded by for-profit entities to attack well-meaning non-profit airports with blatantly misleading marketing. Without airports, we have no airlines. A4A and its constituent airlines need to be good partners and present the facts as they are, without embellishment. As my high school debate coach used to preach, &#8220;If your position is strong, there&#8217;s no need to mislead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned a few times that PFCs are just one way airports are funded. Another is through Grants-in-Aid for Airports via the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/budget/aatf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airports and Airways Trust Fund</a> (AATF). Money in this fund comes from a 7.5% sales tax on airline tickets, as well as taxes on fuel and other aviation-related goods and services. As noted by our friend <a href="http://www.nycaviation.com/2019/01/how-existing-funding-could-keep-the-faa-open-in-a-future-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Rainey on NYCaviation</a>, the 7.5% tax on tickets does not apply to airline fees. Airline fees are those so-called &#8220;optional&#8221; add-ons such as checking a bag, changing a flight, or even selecting a seat. I find it curious that an industry which has taken such a liking to fees to suddenly lash out at airports for wanting the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">option</span> to make modest increases to their own. The hypocritical nature of airlines collecting less in taxes due to unbundling, while profiting from their own fees and attempting to deny airports funding is really quite incredible.</p>
<p>This hypocrisy is obvious. So much in fact that Airlines for America&#8217;s marketing program on Twitter prompted a severe backlash from the general public. Chipping in a few bucks to airports, it seems, isn&#8217;t the polarizing issue A4A had hoped it would be. A4A seems to have learned their lesson, and on June 6 pivoted their disinformation campaign away from <a href="https://twitter.com/airlinesdotorg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AirlinesDotOrg</a> to their less obvious <a href="https://twitter.com/stopairtaxnow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@StopAirTaxNow</a> account. From my perspective, hiding behind a less obvious account only proves the point that this isn&#8217;t a winning issue in the public eye.</p>

<h3>What do the airports have to say?</h3>
<p>It turns out that the airports have their own lobbying group, called the Airports Council International, (ACI). I reached out to Scott Elmore, VP of marketing and communications for the North American region, to get their take on A4A&#8217;s arguments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8220;The same airlines that have no issue charging fees for checked bags, seat assignments, and reservation changes are trying to block airports from making much-needed infrastructure upgrades. Despite what airlines say, America’s airports face $128 billion in infrastructure upgrades over the next few years. Anyone who has been in an airport recently can attest to that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While chatting with Scott and his PR representatives I presented the claims that A4A makes on their <a href="https://stopairtaxnow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StopAirTaxNow</a> site. Below are the A4A claims with the ACI-NA comment presented as they are. You be the judge&#8211; Is it too much to ask that airports be allowed the option to make modest increases to the PFC to help fund infrastructure? Or are the airlines right? Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Airlines:</strong> Customers are already paying $6.9 billion per year in airport taxes, helping airport revenues to soar to a record of nearly $30 billion.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> The cost of operating an airport is high. After airports cover their daily operating expenses there is little left for capital intensive infrastructure projects. In addition, airports are required to hold large cash reserves when they utilize the bond market to finance projects. Airports face almost $92 billion in debt right now to pay off past projects, and the borrowing costs are excessive thanks to a restricted PFC.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines:</strong> There is also almost $7 billion sitting in the aviation trust fund—that’s billions of dollars that can be spent on infrastructure instead of charging passengers more.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> The big airlines fall short of actually saying the unobligated balance in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund should go to airports. The trust fund – which is used to fund AIP grants, FAA facilities and equipment, and the air traffic control system – may enjoy a healthy balance today, but that has not always been the case. It would be irresponsible to bankrupt a trust fund that is so important to all of FAA’s activities.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines:</strong> Airport revenues are diverted off-airport every year – almost $5.4 billion in the past 10 years – money that could have been used for airport infrastructure.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> This is missing a lot of context. Congress has exempted 12 “port authorities” from the FAA’s revenue diversion rule because of the complexity of bond issuances for the handful of affected airports. In the case of these airports, it is the authority, state, or city that actually issues the bond, rather than the airport itself. Changing this standard – even for this small group of impacted airports – would have significant negative implications on the authorities as bondholders, could jeopardize billions of dollars of construction projects and thousands of jobs, and undo local financial agreements that have been in place for decades.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines:</strong> U.S. airports have $14.5 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on hand – roughly 381 days of liquidity.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> This is also missing context. Airports follow generally accepted accounting definitions when they complete the FAA Form 127, and have reported $14.2 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on hand as of the end of FY2016.  But that does not mean that simply because cash is characterized as “Unrestricted” it is available to be spent for any purpose, as the airlines mistakenly argue. It is important to understand that, in reality, only an estimated $2.3 billion is truly unrestricted and available for new capital projects, not the $14.2 billion claimed by the airlines.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines: </strong>Airports are investment-grade entities with ample access to the bond market. Strong credit ratings allow airports to access capital markets at preferred rates. All airports fall within the investment-grade ratings of AA±, A± and BBB±.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> There is nothing wrong with having investment grade credit-rating. That shows airports are prudently managing their financial situation. But that does not mean that airports have access to unlimited borrowing. All the debt needs to be paid back eventually. There needs to be steady revenue stream to back the bonds issued. If airports can’t show steady future revenue stream to pay back the debt, they are unable to borrow more. Borrowing also makes the projects more expensive. In some long-term bond issuance, the interest component can be higher than the cost for the project itself. The essence for borrowing is to push the cost into the future. Airport CFOs look at all financing options to optimize their capital structure.</p>

Today, he is sharing some parts of his new book, Boeing 747. Queen of the Skies: Reflections from the Flight Deck (we get no kick-back from the book, just want to share some cool AvGeekness -- yes, that is now a thing). Zupp's background ranges from charter work and flight instruction to ferry flights, flight testing, and the airlines. He has also served as both a Chief Pilot and Chief Flying Instructor. With 20 years in airline operations, Owen has flown both domestically and across the globe from his Australian base. He holds a Masters Degree in Aviation Management and his writings on aviation have been published around the world and received various accolades and awards. He is also just a cool guy! -Editor</p>
<p>To many, the Boeing 747 is more than merely a means of air travel. Affectionately called the “Queen of the Skies”, its arrival transformed the globe and over more than half a century it has carved its own niche in the history of aviation.</p>
<p>Its significance was recently impressed upon me by the number of queries I have received, both in person and via my website, that relate to the Boeing 747. Even though my career has seen me operate a hundred different types - the “Queen” continues to consume the lion’s share of interest.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate in that as an airline pilot and aviation writer, I have been privy to some very interesting 747 operations. From flying over the Antarctica to ferrying a fifth engine beneath the wing, I have been able to research and share a range of experiences.</p>
<p>As a consequence, I thought it was time to put these stories together in one place and the title, “Boeing 747 - Queen of the Skies. Reflections from the Flight Deck” was born.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post written by Owen Zupp, who has previously written a few great stories on AirlineReporter. Today, he is sharing some parts of his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X3ST2T6">Boeing 747. Queen of the Skies: Reflections from the Flight Deck</a> (we get no kick-back from the book, just want to share some cool AvGeekness &#8212; yes, that is now a thing). Zupp&#8217;s background ranges from charter work and flight instruction to ferry flights, flight testing, and the airlines. He has also served as both a Chief Pilot and Chief Flying Instructor. With 20 years in airline operations, Owen has flown both domestically and across the globe from his Australian base. He holds a Masters Degree in Aviation Management and his writings on aviation have been published around the world and received various accolades and awards. He is also just a cool guy! -Editor</em></p>
<p>To many, the Boeing 747 is more than merely a means of air travel. Affectionately called the “Queen of the Skies”, its arrival transformed the globe and over more than half a century it has carved its own niche in the history of aviation.</p>
<p>Its significance was recently impressed upon me by the number of queries I have received, both in person and via my website, that relate to the Boeing 747. Even though my career has seen me operate a hundred different types &#8211; the “Queen” continues to consume the lion’s share of interest.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate in that as an airline pilot and aviation writer, I have been privy to some very interesting 747 operations. From flying over the Antarctica to ferrying a fifth engine beneath the wing, I have been able to research and share a range of experiences.</p>
<p>As a consequence, I thought it was time to put these stories together in one place and the title, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X3ST2T6">Boeing 747 &#8211; Queen of the Skies. Reflections from the Flight Deck</a>” was born.</p>
<p>What follows is an excerpt from the title. It relates to the chapter, “Magnificent Desolation”, which saw a Boeing 747-400ER venture southward to the frozen continent of Antarctica.</p>

<h2><strong>Bound for Antarctica</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet quite 05:00 as the day begins for the crew. In Sydney, Flight Dispatch and Pete Dawson at QMET have already been busily gathering the latest data, which the crew can tell from the prompt that appears on their iPads. The flight plan and most recent weather forecasts are available, and everything seems in line with the detailed briefing of the day before.</p>
<p>As the bus moves through the dark and silent Sunday morning streets of Melbourne, Capt. Fitzgerald discusses the weather once again with QMET&#8217;s Peter Dawson on speaker as the rest of the crew listen in. The plan remains, and the route toward Cape Adare is confirmed for the best viewing while the land to the south towards McMurdo appears to have substantial cloud cover.</p>

<p>The glow of iPads is the only illumination as the bus makes its way to the airport. The latest briefing material has been uploaded as well as the flight plan, which includes an additional detail in its ATC flight strip: the maximum viewing time over Antarctica. By the time the crew is seated in the Domestic Terminal&#8217;s briefing room—yes, this is a domestic service—all of the information has been reviewed and the discussion fundamentally reinforces the anticipated plan and considers the critical differences of the Antarctic operation one more time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-55598" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-503x754.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-503x754.jpg 503w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-167x250.jpg 167w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-754x1131.jpg 754w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>The engineers call to advise that the Boeing 747-400 VH-OEG has been fueled to its maximum capacity of just over 178 tonnes, given the current specific gravity (SG) of the fuel. They also confirm that the aircraft has been fitted with the additional audio-visual equipment and that the paperwork has been completed.</p>
<p>Aside from the digital flight plan, there is additional paperwork to be completed for the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) in Hobart. AAD is the government department that approves Qantas to conduct these flights over Antarctica, based on environmental impact studies that Qantas supplies and logs that will be kept during actual flights. The Antarctic Flight Summary and Environment Log will be filled out in real time beyond 60 degrees South latitude and submitted to AAD post-flight.</p>
<p>The pilots then make their way down the hallway where Capt. Buddery addresses the cabin crew for the flight. There is a tangible level of excitement among the crew—a mix of senior flight attendants and relative newcomers who all share a common fascination with the flight that lies ahead.</p>
<p>With well over an hour until departure, the gate lounge is full of excited passengers ranging from school students to a pair celebrating their 90th birthdays. Each with a name tag on their chest and vying for a photograph with the Penguin mascot, there is no mistaking this for your everyday Regular Public Transport service. Even with a comfortable margin of time until the Boeing pushes back, the crew is busy readying the aircraft inside and out. This includes confirming the operation of the specially fitted entertainment system and that it is in working order throughout the cabin.</p>
<p>As the sun edges above the horizon in the east, the last door of the 747 is closed and all is ready for the journey southward.</p>
<div id="attachment_55602" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55602" class="size-medium wp-image-55602" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-754x566.jpeg" alt="Photo: Owen Zupp" width="754" height="566" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-754x566.jpeg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-250x188.jpeg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55602" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Owen Zupp</p></div>
<h2><strong>Flight of a Lifetime</strong></h2>
<p>At 406,000 kilograms (895,000 pounds), the aircraft is still more than 6,000kg (13,000lb) under its maximum takeoff weight. Under Capt. Buddery&#8217;s hand, it lines up on Melbourne&#8217;s Runway 34 and is given takeoff clearance. With the clearance confirmed by the entire crew, the thrust levers are advanced, and the four-engine giant begins to accelerate. At 173 knots, the Boeing is rotated, lifting its nose from the runway to start its climb into the morning sky.</p>
<p>The air is smooth as the four-hour sector to the ice begins. Extensive overcast lies below, and Tasmania only peeks through a break as the 747 passes overhead. Now comes a rare opportunity for the members of the crew to mingle with the passengers and answer a stream of questions about the 747 and the flight details. Interestingly, the pilots have questions of their own for the young PhD students from the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Stationed by one of the doors, the scientists have set up an array of equipment to conduct experiments relating to cosmic radiation and the earth&#8217;s magnetic field. And while they were impressed by the GPS&#8217;s read-out of over 300km/h during the takeoff roll, it’s another instrument that is particularly impressive: the ‘Dip Circle.&#8217;</p>
<p>Measuring around 15cm in diameter, the brass ring possesses a dual-face of glass with a needle inside. It resembles a large, see-through compass and is designed to measure the vertical component of a magnetic field, or ‘dip.&#8217; Made in the 19th Century, this piece of scientific craftsmanship has journeyed to Antarctica before, by boat in 1910.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that science takes its place onboard the Qantas aircraft as Australia’s association with research dates back to 1886, when an Australian Antarctic Committee was founded. Today, Australia has three permanent scientific research stations located in Australian Antarctic Territory: Mawson, Davis, and Casey. In total, there are 40 permanent research stations in Antarctica conducting valuable research under the truly international banner of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, or SCAR.</p>
<p>Enroute, a phone patch has been organized for Capt. Fitzgerald to interview the Casey Station Leader, Christine ‘Chris’ MacMillan, which is broadcast through the cabin. In a fascinating exchange, Chris informs the passengers on various aspects of life at an Antarctic Research Station. How the 120 crew is scaled back to just 30 in the winter months, the importance of working as a team, and recreational activities, which even include a dip into the icy waters on Australia Day.</p>
<p>With two hours remaining until we reach the Antarctic continent, the crew is busy with a range of duties. Critical fuel calculations and maximum viewing times are confirmed, contact is made with McMurdo Station, an updated briefing is obtained from QMet, and the latest QNHs are gathered from various bases in Antarctica. The most conservative QNH is chosen for altimetry purposes when the aircraft descends.</p>
<p>And that time is approaching.</p>

<h2><strong>Land Ho!</strong></h2>
<p>Passing 60 degrees south, the crew commences their additional logs, ensures that the topographical strip maps are at hand, and switches the 747’s heading reference from Magnetic to True as the deviation between the two becomes too great as we near the South Pole.</p>
<p>The cloud cover slowly starts to break up below and then, in the distance, are the jagged peaks of Antarctica. With the QNH, viewing time and critical scenarios double-checked, the aircraft begins its descent to a minimum safe altitude of 18,000 feet. McMurdo has advised that the LC-130 aircraft that was inbound has returned to Christchurch due to a technical issue, making the 747 the only aircraft in the area. Even so, reports are routinely made by CPDLC and broadcast on VHF radio.</p>
<p>Towering Mount Minto comes into view, and the sheer immensity of Antarctica becomes apparent. Landfall is made at Cape Adare as planned before we fly a short westbound leg, but it becomes evident that the meteorological team was correct and a cloud bank lies along that route. Turning back towards the Transantarctic Mountain Range, the view is spectacular, made the more so by the pristine air.</p>
<p>There are mountain peaks and razor-edged ranges, glaciers at every turn. Some are filled with reef-like lines of blue ice, which forms when snow falls on a glacier and becomes compressed, squeezing out air bubbles and allowing the ice crystals to enlarge. Beyond the coast, the water is partially covered by pack-ice with mammoth, mesa-like icebergs rising from the sea while their greater mass lurks below.</p>

I flew an airplane totally by myself over the Labor Day weekend. It was, in absolutely equal parts, terrifying and exhilarating.</p>
<p>Doing this was the culmination of a lifelong dream. Unlike a lot of airplane nerds, I don't have any close family who had ties to aviation. Instead, all of this started for me as a boy - my grandmother would take my brother and me to our little local general aviation (GA) airport in Western Massachusetts, where we'd lie on the hood of her ’69 Beetle and watch skydivers while eating ice cream. My interest in planes waxed and waned over the years, but never really went away. There was a time when *gasp* I was afraid of flying - my first-ever flight experience was a very turbulent series of flights down the Atlantic Coast in the height of summer that put me off flying for a long time.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about a decade ago, when my wife got us a helicopter tour of Seattle for my birthday. The desire to fly returned with a vengeance. And the fear had long faded.</p>
<p>Anyway, at a flight school like Galvin, periodic stage checks ensure students are properly prepared to advance to the next segment of training by having them work with different instructors, who both confirm the students' competency and verify that the primary instructor has done their work properly. Some find the process cumbersome; for me the rigor is comforting.</p>

<p><em>This is a continuation of my multi-part series on learning to fly. <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/tag/fly-with-francis/">You can read the whole Fly With Francis series here</a>.</em></p>
<p>I did it! I flew an airplane totally by myself over the Labor Day weekend. It was, in absolutely equal parts, terrifying and exhilarating.</p>
<p>Doing this was the culmination of a lifelong dream. Unlike a lot of airplane nerds, I don&#8217;t have any close family with ties to aviation. Instead, all of this started for me as a boy &#8211; my grandmother would take my brother and me to our little local general aviation (GA) airport in western Massachusetts, where we&#8217;d lie on the hood of her ’69 Beetle and watch skydivers while eating ice cream. My interest in planes waxed and waned over the years, but never really went away. There was a time when *gasp* I was afraid of flying &#8211; my first-ever flight experience was a very turbulent series of flights down the Atlantic Coast in the height of summer that put me off flying for a long time.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about a decade ago, when my wife got us a helicopter tour of Seattle for my birthday. The desire to fly returned with a vengeance. And the fear had long faded.</p>

<p>Anyway, at a flight school like <a href="https://galvinflying.com/">Galvin</a>, periodic stage checks ensure students are properly prepared to advance to the next segment of training by having them work with different instructors, who both confirm the students&#8217; competency and verify that the primary instructor has done their work properly. Some find the process cumbersome; for me the rigor is comforting.</p>

<p>On the Thursday before the Labor Day long weekend, I had a one-hour ground session with an instructor who I&#8217;d seen around Galvin, but hadn&#8217;t worked with before. He asked me lots of questions about FAA regulations, Galvin&#8217;s house rules, where to find info about specific equipment required for airworthiness, and a bunch of stuff from the FAR/AIM (Federal Aviation Regulations / Aeronautical Information Manual), which is basically the bible for aviation regulations.</p>
<p>It went well; I&#8217;d expected an oral exam, but it was more of a conversation. I knew it would be open book, so I was allowed to look stuff up that I didn&#8217;t know, as there&#8217;s way too much stuff for anybody to possibly memorize. The important part is knowing where in the FAR/AIM to find the info.</p>
<p>I will confess to having been quite stressed out about all of this. I <em>really</em> wanted to succeed. The stress was all self-generated, but it was stress just the same. The folks at Galvin were patient and supportive and pretty much awesome. But I can&#8217;t remember ever being so nervous about an endeavor.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, I had a one-hour evaluation flight with yet a different instructor. On this flight, she told me her hope was to simply sit quietly and observe, not having to intervene in any way while I took us from the ramp out to one of the nearby practice areas, demonstrated whichever maneuvers she requested, fly back, and do three touch-and-gos, with a couple simulated emergency surprises tossed in along the way.</p>
<div id="attachment_55539" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55539" class="size-medium wp-image-55539" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_7829-e1567644838104-566x754.jpg" alt="Sticky tabs are a student pilot's best friend." width="566" height="754" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_7829-e1567644838104-566x754.jpg 566w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_7829-e1567644838104-188x250.jpg 188w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_7829-e1567644838104-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_7829-e1567644838104-754x1005.jpg 754w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55539" class="wp-caption-text">Sticky tabs are a student pilot&#8217;s best friend</p></div>
<p>She&#8217;d be verifying that I could do the following without error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preflight the plane, including obtaining the weather briefing and related info</li>
<li>Get appropriate taxi clearance and correctly follow the instructions</li>
<li>Do the engine run-up and remaining preflight checklist items</li>
<li>Get takeoff clearance</li>
<li>Properly read back all ATC instructions and then properly follow said instructions</li>
<li>Take off and maintain proper altitudes and course headings (SEA&#8217;s Class B airspace extends over BFI, and Renton Municipal&#8217;s airspace abuts BFI&#8217;s to the southeast, so there&#8217;s no room for variances in altitude or heading)</li>
<li>Navigate to the practice area, and self-announce what I&#8217;m doing before I do it via the practice-area UNICOM frequency so other aircraft in the area know what I&#8217;m doing (everyone else in the practice area does this, too, so we all know who&#8217;s doing what, and where they&#8217;re doing it)</li>
<li>Perform the requested maneuvers &#8211; in this case, she asked me to demonstrate slow flight, slow turns, a power-on stall, and deal with a simulated engine fire</li>
<li>Return to BFI, getting the current weather on the way, communicating with ATC to get clearance to return to the airport for pattern work, maintaining proper airspace awareness and appropriate altitudes, pattern entry point, airspeeds, etc.</li>
<li>Do three touch-and-go landings, one without using flaps</li>
<li>Execute one go-around maneuver</li>
<li>Land, complete checklists, get taxi clearance, and return to the Galvin ramp</li>
</ul>
<p>There was some other stuff in there, too. It all went really well. The next morning would be my solo flight.</p>

<p>And what a day it was. Mostly clear skies with calm winds. August 31. In an awesome coincidence, it was also my beloved (and dearly departed) grandmother&#8217;s birthday, the woman who inadvertently started me on this path by simply trying to entertain two boys in a small Massachusetts town all those years ago.</p>
<p>My instructor accompanied me on the first two trips around the pattern (after all the normal preflight stuff, etc., of course). We then taxied back to the ramp, parked, and shut down the plane.</p>
<p>He got out, went through the formalities of verifying the validity of my student pilot certificate, my third-class medical certificate, and my photo ID before writing an endorsement in my logbook authorizing me to fly solo.</p>
<p>He smiled, wished me luck, and went to stand on the edge of the ramp to watch, holding an aviation radio, just in case I needed his help. This is referred to as a supervised solo.</p>
<p>Those first two warm-up laps really helped boost my confidence. The checklists took care of my remaining jitters, as they gave me plenty to do and, by checking off the items, reminded me that I actually was prepared for this.</p>

<p>OK. Let&#8217;s do this.</p>
<p>Get taxi clearance, and don&#8217;t forget to state that I&#8217;m a student pilot per the rules so ATC knows what&#8217;s up. Taxi to the hold area. Switch to tower frequency and get takeoff clearance, taxi onto the runway, line up on centerline. Slowly apply full power, being sure to add enough right rudder to keep the plane straight. Note when the airspeed indicator comes alive. At 55 knots, rotate.</p>
<p>The plane practically leapt off the ground, surprising me a tiny bit. I knew the performance would be better with only one person in the plane, but it was markedly better.</p>
<p>I climbed quickly to 700 feet, and made the crosswind turn into the pattern. I reached the pattern altitude of 1,000 feet as I was turning downwind, so I simultaneously throttled back and pitched down a bit to arrest the climb during the turn.</p>
<p>From there, I flew straight along the power lines until abeam the numbers at the end of the runway, visible to my left, all the while listening for ATC to issue me a landing clearance, then responding appropriately to the radio call. And then I went back to talking out loud to make sure I didn&#8217;t forget anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once abeam the numbers, reduce power to 1,500 rpm to start the descent. Below 110 knots, set flaps to 10˚. When we&#8217;re 45 degrees from the end of the runway, begin the crosswind turn. Once stabilized on the crosswind leg, set flaps to 20˚. Turn to final. Look at the glideslope indicator to the left of the runway to be sure I&#8217;m on the right glideslope.&#8221; One red and one white light is what I want. Two white means too high, two red means too low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set flaps to full. Keep the airplane on the extended runway centerline, correcting for any crosswind drift, crabbing into the wind as required. Continue to maintain glideslope. When close to the runway threshold, reduce power, eyes down the runway, perform the flare, set the plane down gently on the main gear.&#8221; Once the nose wheel is on the ground, slide your feet up the rudder pedals to press on the tops to switch to the wheel brakes and steering (you steer on the ground with your feet, not the yoke). Apply brakes to slow down, select a taxiway exit, turn off the active runway.</p>
<p>Come to a full stop with all parts of the aircraft across the the hold-position line. Complete the after-landing checklist. Don&#8217;t forget to breathe. Switch the radio back to ground frequency, request taxi clearance back to 14L.</p>
<p>Do this a total of three times.</p>
<p>Rolling out after the third landing, let out a whoop that&#8217;s so loud you almost deafen yourself via the mic in the headset. Stop, get taxi clearance. Laugh like a giddy fool the rest of the way to the ramp. Have a beaming instructor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_solo_flight">ruin a perfectly good T-shirt</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_55516" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55516" class="wp-image-55516 size-medium" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_7854-e1567396921323-754x754.jpg" alt="The remnants of the shirt I was wearing during solo.

I now consider it a trophy.</p></div>
<p>What&#8217;s next? Another supervised solo, this time with touch-and-go landings instead of full-stop landings, then on to training with the instructor for soft- and short-field landings, and then cross-country flying and all the flight planning and navigation stuff that entails.</p>
<p>Lots more to come.</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, Canadians have complained about the cost of domestic air travel. Stuck in an increasingly permanent duopoly, Air Canada and WestJet have been without significant competition for the past 15 years. When JetsGo ceased operations in 2005, the domestic market was handed over to two carriers with little interest in changing the status quo. Moreover, with the ability to control prices and adjust capacity, Canada's two flag carriers have been able to stifle their competition. Additionally, as a result of the duopoly, the barrier to entry for new market entrants has gone up significantly.</p>
<p>Part of the problem lies in Canada's geography. With a population smaller than Tokyo spread over an area larger than the United States, it's no wonder that airlines have struggled to succeed in Canada. While there is considerable traffic between the major urban areas (Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal), there is very little flow between Canada's smaller cities. This makes profitability a major struggle for new market entrants, especially when the major routes are dominated by Air Canada and WestJet.</p>
<p>Start of the Transition</p>
<p>However, things may be about to change. Three carriers (Rouge, Flair, and Swoop) are currently offering low-fare travel options and a fourth, Canada Jetlines, is on the way. Each with their own identity, the three existing carriers have thus far managed to stay afloat in Canada's notoriously turbulent market. But for how long? That remains to be seen. With low-cost travel finally taking off, it's worth taking a closer look at how they've managed to attract and maintain business. We'll be taking a look at their origins, cost structure, and the quirks which have kept them in business and, later in my story, I'll be including my brief interview with Swoop President Steven Greenway.</p>

<h3>Start of the Transition</h3>
<p>However, things may be about to change. Three carriers (Rouge, Flair, and Swoop) are currently offering low-fare travel options and a fourth, Canada Jetlines,<a href="https://www.wingsmagazine.com/canada-jetlines-targets-december-launch/"> is on the way</a>. Each with their own identity, the three existing carriers have thus far managed to stay afloat in Canada&#8217;s notoriously turbulent market. But for how long? That remains to be seen. With low-cost travel finally taking off, it&#8217;s worth taking a closer look at how they&#8217;ve managed to attract and maintain business. We&#8217;ll be taking a look at their origins, cost structure, and the quirks which have kept them in business and, later in my story, I&#8217;ll be including my brief interview with Swoop President Steven Greenway.</p>

<h3>Rouge: Air Canada&#8217;s newest gamble</h3>
<p>With their eyes on mainline expansion, Air Canada&#8217;s Leisure group became increasingly forgotten as costs started to exceed passenger demand. By 2012, something needed to be done. With Transat, WestJet Vacations, and Sunwing Travel dominating the &#8220;Snowbird Sector&#8221;, a creative, cost-effective solution became a necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus: </strong><em><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2013/07/air-canada-rouge-first-flight-of-a-new-leisure-airline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air Canada Rouge-First Flight of a New &#8220;Leisure&#8221; Airline</a></em></p>
<p>Enter Benjamin Smith, Air Canada&#8217;s President of Passenger Airlines. If Air Canada was to re-enter the leisure market, Smith realized they would need to reduce their labor and operational costs. However, this wouldn&#8217;t be easy. The bulk of Air Canada&#8217;s flight attendants and line pilots are currently members of a union group: <a href="https://cupe.ca/">CUPE</a> (Flight Attendants) or <a href="https://acpa.ca/">ACPA</a> (Pilots). Consequently, this made negotiating contracts extremely difficult. Also, history was not on Air Canada&#8217;s side.</p>
<h4>Tango and Zip: Learning from past mistakes</h4>
<p>Shortly after merging with Canadian Airlines, Air Canada launched two budget airlines to try and fend off WestJet and Canada 3000. <em>Tango</em> offered low-frill service between Air Canada&#8217;s main hubs (Trans-Con Operations) and flew &#8220;Snowbirds&#8221; down to the southern United States. Zip, on the other hand, primarily competed with WestJet, who at the time was dominating the low-cost sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_55135" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55135" class="size-medium wp-image-55135" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-754x433.jpg" alt="Air Canada Rouge A319 Taxiing at YVR" width="754" height="433" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-754x433.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-250x144.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-768x441.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55135" class="wp-caption-text">Operating a mixed fleet of A319s and 767s, Rouge expanded to Western Canada in 2014 &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>

<p>Ultimately, Tango ended up cannibalizing Air Canada&#8217;s mainline routes while Zip&#8217;s relatively high labor costs inhibited their ability to discount fares. Neither subsidiary had performed to the standards expected by the airlines&#8217; executives. Tango ceased flying in 2003. While the airline ceased operating, the brand remained as a fare class for the parent carrier. Zip, on the other hand, continued operating until September 2004 before terminating service for good. The brand has never resurfaced and Air Canada vacated the low-cost market.</p>
<h4>Domestic Expansion: Taking advantage of scope clauses</h4>
<p>In their return to the budget sector, Air Canada has struck gold with Rouge. Ben Smith managed to negotiate a fantastic deal for the parent company while also creating something &#8220;reasonably&#8221; fair for the pilots and flight attendants. The scope clauses negotiated have allowed the airline to expand in the domestic market without imposing on AC&#8217;s mainline network.</p>
<p>Crucially, Rouge offers Air Canada something that its Express brand can&#8217;t: lower costs with room for capacity growth. Over the past few years, we have seen this manifested in a couple of different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new cross-country services that were previously been uneconomical
<ul>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> <em><a href="https://ehviationblogger.wordpress.com/2017/12/21/hot-air-5-swiping-left-on-swoop-decembers-route-roundup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rouge expands service to Kamloops and Nanaimo</a> via EHviation</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Up-gauging Air Canada Express routes to &#8220;mainline&#8221; aircraft with higher capacity and lower <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/casm.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost per Available Seat Mile</a>. This also allows for additional cargo capacity.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To date, Rouge has been reasonably well-received by Canadians. Passengers are able to redeem their Aeroplan miles, connect through Air Canada&#8217;s global network (interline), and, for a fee, gain access to Air Canada&#8217;s <em>Maple Leaf Lounge.</em></p>
<p>With a long-term strategy in place, Rouge is well-positioned for future success.</p>
<h3>Flair Airlines: Turning over a NewLeaf</h3>
<div id="attachment_55239" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55239" class="wp-image-55239 size-medium" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-754x471.jpg" alt="Flair Air 737-400 arriving at YVR" width="754" height="471" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-754x471.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-250x156.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55239" class="wp-caption-text">Founded in 2005 as cargo/charter carrier, Flair Airlines incorporated virtual airline NewLeaf on July 25th, 2017 &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>
<h4>Origins and Context</h4>
<p>As we continue our look at Canada&#8217;s low-cost carriers, this is definitely the one that you haven&#8217;t heard of before. Perhaps the most interesting of the three, Flair Airlines, started operations in 2005 as a charter/cargo operator. Since rebranding and adopting a low-cost business model, Flair has carved out a niche in Canada&#8217;s domestic market. While they have achieved some success, Flair continues to face the most adversity. Without the support of a parent carrier, Flair is on its own against Canada&#8217;s domestic giants.</p>
<p>Based in Edmonton (AB), Flair&#8217;s mixed fleet of 737s is one of the oldest in Canada. With that in mind, the airline is currently in the process of replacing their -400s with leased -800s, something that will continue through 2020. As of right now, their closest competitor is WestJet&#8217;s subsidiary <em>Swoop</em>. While on paper they target the same subset of the market, the two carriers actually have very different networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_55238" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55238" class="size-medium wp-image-55238" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-754x462.jpg" alt="Flair Air 737 parked at YVR - Photo: John Jamieson" width="754" height="462" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-754x462.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-250x153.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-768x470.jpg 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55238" class="wp-caption-text">Flair Air 737 parked at YVR &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>
<h4>Doing things Differently</h4>
<p>While Swoop may shout about their nine dollar fares, Flair is arguably doing more to drive down prices. Instead of serving secondary markets, they are trying to reduce fares between mainline destinations. If the carrier can withstand the short-term financial challenges, they have a chance to really establish themselves in the Canadian market.</p>
<p>Bucking the low-cost trend, Flair raised eyebrows when they chose to operate flights into Canada&#8217;s two largest airports: Vancouver (YVR) and Toronto (YYZ). When Flair began service between YVR and YYZ, they undercut both Air Canada and WestJet. While the two giants have since responded by slashing fares, Flair continues to operate direct service on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Flair is more in touch with Canadians than Swoop or Rouge: they provide low fares on routes that matter. While Swoop may offer more attractive destinations, Flair is sticking around thanks to the loyalty they&#8217;re showing to Canadians.</p>
<h3>Swoop: WestJet&#8217;s Canadian SPIRIT</h3>
<div id="attachment_55372" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55372" class="wp-image-55372 size-medium" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-754x432.jpg" alt="A Swoop 737-800 Parked at YXX" width="754" height="432" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-754x432.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-250x143.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55372" class="wp-caption-text">Established as a low-cost fighting brand, Swoop serves secondary markets and caters to millennials &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>
<p>Following the demise and acquisition of Canadian Airlines, WestJet started drifting away from its low-cost roots. After quashing the hopes of Montreal-based start-up Jetsgo, WestJet set its sights on Air Canada. If you need a reminder of how the carrier transitioned from a friendly budget carrier to a profit-focused hybrid airline, check out our recent look at WestJet and its partnership with Delta.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus: <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2019/05/westjet-driven-forward-by-delta/">WestJet: Driven Forward by Delta</a></strong></p>
<p>In a twist of irony, especially given their new slogan, WestJet&#8217;s owners may &#8220;Love where they&#8217;re going&#8221; but Canada&#8217;s cost-sensitive travelers certainly don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>As WestJet moved closer to Air Canada, a chasm opened up beneath their wings. As they began spurning budget travelers, WestJet&#8217;s competitors began to take notice. Air Canada was the first to respond (Rouge), followed shortly by a new market entrant: Flair Air (through the acquisition of Newleaf). All of a sudden, WestJet&#8217;s role as a low-cost small-market carrier was in jeopardy. In order to re-establish its position in the low-cost realm, the airline needed a fighting brand with a charismatic, yet competent, individual running the show. Enter Steven Greenway and Swoop.</p>
<h4>Men at Work: the man from &#8220;Down Under&#8221;</h4>
<p>Hailing from Australia, Swoop&#8217;s inaugural President is a certified &#8220;AvGeek.&#8221; A longtime Boeing fan (with particular emphasis on the Queen of the Skies), Steven had the opportunity to fly on Cathay Pacific&#8217;s final 747 flight in 2016. Having worked for low-cost carriers <strong><a href="https://www.virginaustralia.com/eu/en/?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virgin Blue</a> </strong>(now Virgin Australia) and Singapore Airlines&#8217; ULCC<strong>, </strong>Scoot<strong>, </strong>he also knows a thing or two about low-cost operations and e-commerce. During an event in Abbotsford, I had the chance to catch up with Greenway for a quick interview.</p>

<h3>Interview With Swoop&#8217;s President</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>John Jamieson (JJ): </strong>Hi Steven, thanks for taking the time to meet! We&#8217;re here in Abbotsford celebrating the recent expansion of their passenger terminal. For a low-cost airline like Swoop, how important is it to partner with a cost-friendly airport such as Abbotsford?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Steven Greenway (SG)</strong>: It&#8217;s incredibly important from our standpoint. Being able to operate into an airport with reduced landing fees and lower handling expenses, we&#8217;re able to pass those savings along to our passengers, while stimulating new traffic for the airport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>JJ</strong>: Are there any plans to base any aircraft or establish a crew hub at YXX?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SG: </strong>If all of our expansion plans fall into place, we hope to begin basing a couple of 737-800s at YXX later this year.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JJ:</strong> Has the airline looked at Abbotsford as a potential connecting hub for destinations to the United States?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SG: </strong>Currently, the costs associated with connecting flights don&#8217;t offset the potential revenue gains. While this may be re-examined in the future, solidifying our <em>Origin and Destination </em>(O&amp;D) network remains our number one priority.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JJ: </strong>Lastly, in October of 2018, we learned that Swoop is to be included in WestJet&#8217;s Transborder joint venture with Delta Airlines. Will the airline be actively involved in the &#8220;JV&#8221; (ie. interlining, shared ground equipment, new services)? and secondly, will there be new emphasis at Swoop as far as entering existing Delta markets in the United States?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SG: </strong>As far as our involvement in the Joint Venture is concerned, we&#8217;ve opted to explore the agreement&#8217;s secondary benefits as opposed to interlining and codesharing. In terms of Swoop exploring new markets in the United States, our primary focus will be on revenue and network scheduling. Additionally, considering the airports we operate from in Canada, we&#8217;ll need to determine if those markets can handle international arrivals.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>My Canadian LCC Conclusion: </strong></h3>
<p>Without having tried Flair or Swoop, I can&#8217;t comment on their level of service or the reliability of their operations. While both airlines have been through rocky patches, neither has been forced to make major network cuts. On the other hand, my sole experience with Rouge in 2016 was more or less like my recent experience with United Airlines: unremarkable. While Rouge has been the most successful Canadian LCC in recent years, their base fares remain above Flair and Swoop.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the success or failure of these three carriers rides on the back of middle-class families and millennials. If the airlines can successfully attract new customers and reduce the cost of domestic air travel in Canada, they may stand a chance of being more than a one-year wonder.</p>

<p>At the beginning of August, JetSuiteX went through a rebrand and announced its new identity as JSX, accompanied with a new website <a href="http://www.jsx.com">jsx.com</a>. JSX’s new name is a testament to its evolution since its inception in 2016. The company has always aimed to provide “Joyful, Simple Experiences” in its innovative form of air travel as a “hop-on jet service.”</p>
<p>JSX currently offers publicly available charter flights on 30-seat jets from private terminals out of seven airports: Burbank (BUR), Las Vegas (LAS), Orange County (SNA), Napa/Concord (CCR), Oakland (OAK), Seattle-Boeing Field (BFI), and Phoenix (PHX).</p>
<p>Lovers of aviation make up a unique community unlike any other, and JSX’s experienced travelers seem to be the most in-the-know thanks to its elevated and efficient service on short distance flights in highly desirable markets. Luckily for frequent travelers, the company continues to work toward improving the aviation industry. As JSX’s co-founder and CEO Alex Wilcox shares, “it’s an industry that once you start working in, it’s really hard to get out.”</p>

<p>Wilcox has been spearheading advancement within the aviation industry since the beginning of his career, such as all-leather economy seats with built-in LiveTV systems at JetBlue, where he was a founding executive. Fast forward to 2016, Wilcox founded what is now JSX, a public charter company with the idea to give a super fast and convenient service to its customers. The company is known to serve travelers with “the best of private travel at not-so-private fares.”</p>
<p>The JSX team saw a need for cheaper and more convenient travel, and set out to fix it. “It’s cheaper now than it’s ever been in history to get from Point A to Point B on Planet Earth,” explains Wilcox. “Millions of people fly every year but one market, at least in this country, has been left behind: short-haul flights.” In the private business, people pay upward of $5,000 to fly from airports such as Oakland to Seattle with 1-2 persons on board. At JSX, the 30-person carrier semi-private jet offers one way tickets for roughly $200.</p>
<p>“That’s what we’re here to fix,” says Wilcox. “The premise is you show up 20 minutes before the flight, you get on and you go. We’re creating a joyfully simple experience, and something that our customers are really loving.”</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, JSX started flights from Seattle-Boeing Field to Oakland, two major tech hubs in the U.S., adding ease for business travelers.

Should there be some line of convenience vs doing what's right, and is this new policy crossing it? Honestly, I don't know the answers.

<p class="p1">First, here is the official write up from the airport:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Airport tenants, vendors, and permittees may not provide or sell bottled water in containers that contain plastic or aseptic paper packaging, including in vending machines. Reusable water bottles, recyclable aluminum, glass and certified compostable water bottles can instead be provided or sold.</p>
<p class="p1">Bottled water is defined as drinking water in a sealed box, bag, can, bottle, or other container intended primarily for single-service use and having a capacity of one liter or less.  Drinking water includes purified water, mineral water, carbonated or sparkling water, and electrolyte-enhanced water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p1">SFO has been making positive strides forward with going green this year, and a big cheers to them. Back in March, they started encouraging vendors to use reusable food service ware, and can only give customers one-use items if they are certified compostable (i.e. made with paper, wood, or bamboo). During <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2019/04/pay-the-anxiety-away-flying-uniteds-first-class/">my recent flight through SFO</a>, I was able to try out some of these and I will say I am not a huge fan of using a paper straw. I actually rather use no straw vs paper, and I guess that is probably the point! I do not think it is that much of a sacrifice for the greater good and I am guessing that most passengers will not even notice or care.</p>
<div id="attachment_55479" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55479" class="size-medium wp-image-55479" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-754x683.png" alt="Approved water options that vendors can use after the ban goes into effect - Image: SFO" width="754" height="683" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-754x683.png 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-250x226.png 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-768x696.png 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM.png 1212w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55479" class="wp-caption-text">Approved water options that vendors can use after the ban goes into effect &#8211; Image: SFO</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;">I will say when I was first looking into this, I wasn&#8217;t the biggest fan. People are going to notice the change and might care about 10,000 times per day. However, after seeing that SFO is not planning to leave passengers high and dry (man, I love puns), this might not be that bad of a transition and maybe they can pull it off without frustrating too many people. The list above are all the approved water products that vendors can offer &#8212; and there are a lot. You will see that they are either made of aluminum or glass. The airport also offers plenty of hydration stations (ie places where you can fill up your own bottle quickly), but hopefully there will be enough with the increased demand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe part of my hesitation is just being a grumpy old man saying “get off my lawn” (at the age of 38) and having a hard time with change. I am not trying to be that person. I really hope that this ends up working and makes a positive impact with the reduction of plastic. I just know that flying is a pretty stressful experience for most people (even AvGeeks) and trying to get water shouldn’t add to the stress. At the same time, the vendors will also need to make sure the new options remain cost effective. I was told that if the water bottle change is successful, the airport will be looking to also replace other drinks in plastic bottles like soda, teas, and juices (saying options for those products in different containers improve). I truly hope this transition is a success and can spread to other airports. Until then, I will optimistically watch from the sidelines.</span></p>

<p>The A330 has been a great international workhorse for airlines, but I have never gone out of my way to fly on one (okay, maybe domestically on Hawaiian once). &#8220;What&#8217;s the aircraft flying my route? An A330? OMG YES I LOVE THAT PLANE,&#8221; said no one ever.</p>
<p>Of course most passengers aren&#8217;t as concerned with the type of plane they are flying (yes, I know it is shocking to think there are people like that out there), but they are more concerned with the product. Although Delta has been upgrading the interiors of their 777s to the newest product, the A330neo is the first type that has the newest product coming from the factory. I hadn&#8217;t seen the updated interior yet, and even though this was going to be a short visit with the plane on the ground, I still excited to have an opportunity to get onto a plane!</p>

<h2>GETTING SET AT SEA-TAC</h2>
<p>I always love an airline event that doesn&#8217;t require me to get up at 3:00am. With this one, I just needed to be at the Delta counter at 10:30am and get my day pass, which of course is going into my AvGeek collection. You still get to go through security and it prompts fun questions from the TSA agents. &#8220;Uh, I am going to look at an airplane, but not fly anywhere, don&#8217;t worry, it is totally legit&#8221; (pretty close to my actual convo).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I made it through (otherwise this would be a very different story), and we headed to the buses to ride out to our A330-900neo, which was located next to Delta&#8217;s maintenance facility at the south side of the airport.</p>

<p>After de-busing (that is a thing), we walked through a hangar and saw a Delta Boeing 717. A few of us geeked out a bit. The funny part is one of the cameramen (not an AvGeek) started setting up his camera and a Delta employee was asking if they were going to push in the stairs for us to go in. Since a few of us AvGeek media types got so worked up over the plane, they thought this must have been the plane we were all there for. Nope. It just takes a long time to get AvGeeks to move through any airport facility. #sorrynotsorry</p>

<h2>WE ARRIVE TO THE DELTA AIR LINES AIRBUS A330-900neo</h2>
<p>As we walked up to the back of the A330neo, I was super excited to hear the APU going. Why? Because it was a really odd weather combo in Seattle: rain, sun, heatt, and humidity! It felt more like Atlanta than Seattle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most times when I am touring an aircraft like this, I first head to the back, and then make my way forward. This was no different! Here we go&#8230;</p>

<p>First stop was the galley in the rear of the aircraft. It was quite large. The plane we were on was being prepped to fly a scheduled passenger flight, so soon there was going to be plenty of food and drink.</p>
<p>I will mention again that we didn&#8217;t have a heck of a lot of time to tour the plane. Part of it was we spent a lot of time outside the plane (taking photos of the A330neo and of course that 717), and this plane needed to be prepped for people who mattered &#8211; customers. I really didn&#8217;t get to try out much of the product; I just sat, played a bit, asked a few questions, took a few photos, and kept on moving forward (I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on seeing the flight deck).</p>
<p>For cost comparisons that you will see below, I looked at some one-way fares from Seattle to Shanghai on the Delta Airbus A330-900neo between now and the end of the year. With the product really impressing me, I wanted to see how much it would actually cost to fly, so I figured I would share the numbers. I averaged those costs to give a basic comparison, but obviously check delta.com yourself before packing your bags!</p>

<h2>DELTA MAIN CABIN (aka economy)</h2>
<p>Next was the economy section, or as Delta calls it &#8220;<a href="https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/products-and-services/in-flight/main-cabin.html">Main Cabin</a>.&#8221; This is the place where the majority of passengers will fly&#8230; and honestly that is not a bad thing. The inflight entertainment (IFE) screens were large, and reacted quickly to my input. The seats were comfy for my quick sit, but probably not as comfy after a 10-hour flight. Of course with the A330, best to try and get one of the two seats on the edge because sitting in the middle, of the middle, with strangers will make your flight feel even longer. Not wanting to spend too much time in Delta Main Cabin, I kept moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta Main Cabin A330-900neo cost flight: $435</strong></p>

<h2>DELTA COMFORT+ (aka &#8220;premium&#8221; economy)</h2>
<p>The next product forward is <a href="https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/products-and-services/in-flight/delta-comfort-plus.html">Delta Comfort+</a>. This is really your standard economy seat, with some additional legroom. You also get a fun little extra pocket on the seat back, and a red swath on your seat. I will admit that the addition of red in the cabin actually adds a bit of class.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s a good time to mention that the aircraft has air vents!!! I love this. Too few international aircraft have them and as a guy who normally runs hotter, I like having some control of my temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta Comfort+ A330-900neo cost flight: $485<br />
</strong><em>compare that to $435 in Main Cabin</em></p>
<p>Hmm. Okay. So only $100 more for a round-trip ticket in Comfort+, I might actually be interested in that.</p>

<h2>Delta Premium Select (aka domestic first)</h2>
<p>Now we are talking! The Delta Premium Select seat is where I started perking up. I rarely pay extra for more legroom. It just doesn&#8217;t seem like a good purchase, even at 6&#8217;1&#8243;. What I do find helpful is width, especially at 250lbs. The <a href="https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/onboard-experience/delta-premium-economy.html">Delta Premium Select</a> product is the seat that took most of my time (even more than Delta One)&#8230; and that is a good thing.</p>
<p>The seat really felt like an updated and upgraded domestic first class seat. You have a better IFE screen, seat controls, and the ability to recline. With a 2-3-2 layout vs the 2-4-2 layout in the back of the (air)bus, that extra width really makes a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta Premium Select A330-900neo flight cost: $600<br />
</strong><em>compare that to $435 in Main Cabin and $485 in Comfort+</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Dang. Now, I don&#8217;t have lot of extra money to spend on airfare, but $330 more for a round trip ticket in Premium Select vs Main Cabin might be worth it. Or at least paying $165 coming back home (so I can sleep before going back to work).</p>

<h2>Delta One (aka business class)</h2>
<p>You have arrived. <a href="https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/products-and-services/in-flight/delta-one.html">Delta One</a> is the best of the best from Delta and that is saying something. I appreciate that every &#8220;window&#8221; seat actually gets easy access to the window &#8211; not always the case with today&#8217;s business &#8220;suites&#8221; &#8211; and those in the middle of the cabin can easily put down a wall to chat with their seat mate, or put it up and stay private. You have the most room, best controls, lie-flat seat, and even a little slider door to up your privacy level.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta One A330-900neo flight cost: $3350<br />
</strong><em>compare that to $435 in Main Cabin, $485 in Comfort+, and $600 in Premium Select</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Hot damn that is a lot of money (but actually not a bad deal compared to other business class products)! But often it makes sense for passengers (or businesses) to shell out the money or miles to fly in Delta&#8217;s best product. Based on the extra cost, I think it makes Delta Premium Select even a better deal!</p>

<h2>Airbus A330-900neo Flightdeck (aw yea!!!)</h2>
<p>Had to make it to the very front of the plane, and I did! I was only able to chat with a Delta pilot for a small amount of time before I was given the bad news that our time on the plane was coming to an end.</p>

<h2>Final Delta Air Lines Airbus A330-900neo Thoughts</h2>
<p>After getting back to the terminal, we headed on over to the Delta lounge at the airport. I had never been and it was a nice place to sit down, talk airplanes, and think a bit about the A330neo. I was impressed. I think the first time that I fly on a Delta A330-900neo will be the first time I am legitimately excited to fly on an Airbus A330, and maybe (just maybe) I can say that the airline/aircraft combos has become one of my favorites. Maybe.</p>

I had a frustrating flight a week or so ago, where nothing seemed to go smoothly and my memory of the required procedures needed refreshing by the instructor, rather than my just doing them without prompting; it was disheartening.</p>
<p>There have been a couple of flights like that.</p>
<p><span id="more-55194"></span></p>

<p>My most recent flight, however, was a great morale booster. It was a glorious Seattle afternoon &#8211; crystal-clear skies, mostly smooth air, and the wind was blowing straight down the runway. We flew to the Tacoma Narrows Airport (TIW), a lovely tower-controlled field on a bluff near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge">Tacoma Narrows Bridge</a> and phenomenal views of Puget Sound and the mountains.</p>
<p>And it was there that I became convinced that I finally have a handle on landings. I made five of them in the pattern, and all five were good &#8211; a couple were actually really good. Carl, my instructor, said he didn&#8217;t touch the controls once during any of them. It was a great feeling. The landing back at BFI was also pretty good.</p>
<div id="attachment_55396" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55396" class="size-medium wp-image-55396" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190721_8694-754x503.jpg" alt="Tacoma Narrows Airport is in the foreground, Tacoma Narrows Bridge is in the middle, and Mount Rainier is in the distance.

This is why I love to fly in the Pacific Northwest.</p></div>
<p>Handling the radios for the different towers, maintaining clearance from Sea-Tac&#8217;s overlying class B airspace, recognizing landmarks for checking in with the control towers, correctly reading back their instructions, and then following them while performing the required pre-landing checklist items, and then following pattern protocols and landing procedures (i.e., flying the plane), all went pleasingly well.</p>
<p>Now if I can only consistently repeat all of that, plus all the required stage check maneuvers, I&#8217;ll be well on my way toward being qualified for solo flight.</p>
<p>Until then, it&#8217;s practice, practice, practice.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the impact we can have,” Val said. “I had 31 years at Fedex before I came here and that was a good job. They support Orbis with a lot of things including the donation of this airplane. But as an aircraft mechanic, there’s not a lot much you do to give back. So my little part of taking care of the airplane is my way of helping Orbis fulfill its mission.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-55415" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-754x503.jpg" alt="" width="754" height="503" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-754x503.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-250x167.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Val is one of Orbis’ full-time staff members. Its medical professionals and pilots, though, are all volunteers. Many of the pilots work for FedEx, which also flies MD-10 aircraft and donated N330AU to Orbis. The Flying Eye Hospital was at Phoenix Goodyear Airport for nearly two months undergoing a Heavy C Check during the spring of 2018. The Orbis team opened the aircraft for AirlineReporter and explained some of the features that make 330AU one of the most-interesting aircraft in the sky. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The current aircraft is the third Orbis Flying Eye Hospital.</strong> </span></h2>
<div style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg/640px-N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg"><img class="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg/640px-N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg" alt="Orbis DC-8" width="637" height="425" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This DC-8 is the original Orbis Flying Eye Hospital &#8211; Photo: Aeroprints.com via Wikimedia Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Orbis aircraft was a DC-8, which was succeeded by a DC-10. Orbis received N330AU from FedEx in 2008, and it took nearly eight years to convert it from freighter to flying eye hospital.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There’s an interesting story behind the aircraft’s tail number: Let’s start with the “AU” part of it.</strong> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That stands for Al Ueltschi, who was the personal pilot of Juan Trippe. He’s considered among the more-influential minds of modern flight training, and even founded FlightSafety International. As for the 330 part of the registration, that follows the pattern of the first two Orbis aircraft. The DC-8 was N110AU and the DC-10 was N220AU (which is on display at the Pima Air Museum).</span></p>
<h2><strong>Most medical aircraft are transports, but N330AU is certified as an actual hospital.</strong></h2>

<p>The aircraft travels with equipment to provide ground power. It can even convert local water sources to hospital-grade water using an onboard filtration system. The hospital section of N330AU is built from modular units that can be removed to convert it back into a freighter. The units could also be moved to another aircraft; Orbis expects to operate N330AU for 10-15 years.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This area doubles as a classroom, complete with a large-screen TV at the front. There’s also a galley. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of galleys, the original galley has been transformed into a maintenance bay and office. FedEx removed the plane’s original elevator and replaced it with a staircase/ladder. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The hospital equipment and other gear make N330AU a heavy aircraft.</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not in the typical callsign “heavy” way &#8211; heavy in actual weight. Because of the extra weight, it usually doesn’t fly more than eight hours at a time. </span></p>

<h2>Younger patients get extra attention.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each child patient receives a stuffed bear; if the child is having surgery on the right eye, the bear will have a bandage on the right eye. When the child’s procedure is over and the bandages are removed, the bear’s bandage will also be removed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgeries aboard the Flying Eye Hospital take up to four times longer than the same procedure performed elsewhere. That’s because the Orbis volunteer medical professionals use each surgery as a teaching opportunity. They help local medical professionals sharpen their skills and enhance their knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE: All of our tickets to the event have been assigned. See below to be added to the waitlist. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">If you live in the Seattle area, you like airplanes, and you enjoy getting together with other like-minded people, please keep on reading. On July 30th, our friends at <a href="https://thepointsguy.com">The Points Guy</a> will be at the Museum of Flight to host a special aviation-themed event — and you should join!</p>
<p class="p1">What will happen at the event? Fun games, aviation-related presentations, travel discussions, a little Q&amp;A, and the best part is talking to other AvGeeks! (there will also be some food and drinks).</p>
<p class="p1">You will need a ticket, but we might be able to help with that. We were kindly given a few free tickets to give away to our readers.</p>
<p class="p1">The details &amp; how to get your ticket:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What:</strong> Exclusive TPG Aviation Event<br />
<strong>When:</strong> July 30th from 7pm to 9pm<br />
<strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.museumofflight.org">Museum of Flight</a> in Seattle<br />
<strong>Cost: </strong>Nothing, just a smile<strong><br />
Why: </strong>Because<br />
<strong>How to get on the waiting list (updated):</strong>  We have given out all our tickets for the event. If you wanted to be added to the waitlist, you can email me at <a href="mailto:david@airlinereporter.com"><span class="s1">david@airlinereporter.com</span></a> with “TPG” in the subject line. I will know by Sunday if any come available. Thanks!</p>
<p class="p1">Hope to see you there (I will be there, along with a few other AirlineReporter writers)!</p>
