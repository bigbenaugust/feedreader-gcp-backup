<h3>What is Airlines for America?</h3>
<p><a href="http://airlines.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airlines for America</a> (A4A) is an industry trade group which represents most of the major U.S. airlines. <a href="http://airlines.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A4A influences</a> &#8220;on behalf of its members to shape crucial policies and measures&#8230;&#8221; A4A is to airlines what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobacco Institute</a> was for &#8220;big tobacco,&#8221; what the American Medical Association is for doctors, and the Chamber of Commerce is to business. Thinking broadly, these groups are a way for constituents to pool money, share ideas, and ultimately, collectively influence opinion.</p>
<p>Whose opinion are we influencing? Consumers, for sure, but the big money is influencing those in a position to regulate. These consumer-facing calls to action, in fact, urge customers to show their support in a public way which influences elected officials. It turns out the opinion influencing business is a great one to be in. In 2012, NPR&#8217;s Planet Money team <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/06/144737864/forget-stocks-or-bonds-invest-in-a-lobbyist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on</a> a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1375082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> which showed a substantial return on investment for every dollar invested in lobbying. According to the piece: <em>that means for every dollar spent on lobbying, the companies got $220 in [benefits.]</em></p>

<h3>What&#8217;s a PFC?</h3>
<p>A PFC, or Passenger Facility Charge, is what A4A is incorrectly referring to as their so-called &#8220;air tax.&#8221; In fact, PFCs are <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/user-fee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usage fees</a> in that those who use airports pay for them. If you don&#8217;t fly, you don&#8217;t pay. Taxes, on the other hand, are less surgical. My guess is that by intentionally mislabeling this usage fee as a tax, A4A is hoping to successfully kindle the same outrage as when estate taxes were branded by those opposing them as &#8220;death taxes.&#8221; This logic is fundamentally flawed, intentionally deceptive, and throws back to sensationalism in the hopes of reaction.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2015/12/understanding-the-current-debate-over-airport-passenger-facility-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great primer on what PFCs are</a> and how they help airports operate. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from that piece: <em>The PFC is a fee that is automatically applied to the purchase of airfare that airlines collect on behalf of the [airports.] The airlines, in turn, transfer this money over to the airport, minus a small collection fee. [it is variable from airport to airport, but is currently capped at] $4.50 per flight segment, not to exceed $9 for a one-way trip or $18 for round-trip travel. </em>These limits were last adjusted in the year 2000. In the past 19 years, thanks to inflation, the purchasing power of the $4.50 PFC has dropped by at least a third or more by some calculations.</p>

<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
<p>First, we need to address the bad behavior of A4A intentionally misleading consumers. A4A is funded by airlines which in recent years have performed quite well, making record profits. There is no room in public discourse for lobbying firms funded by for-profit entities to attack well-meaning non-profit airports with blatantly misleading marketing. Without airports, we have no airlines. A4A and its constituent airlines need to be good partners and present the facts as they are, without embellishment. As my high school debate coach used to preach, &#8220;If your position is strong, there&#8217;s no need to mislead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned a few times that PFCs are just one way airports are funded. Another is through Grants-in-Aid for Airports via the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/budget/aatf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airports and Airways Trust Fund</a> (AATF). Money in this fund comes from a 7.5% sales tax on airline tickets, as well as taxes on fuel and other aviation-related goods and services. As noted by our friend <a href="http://www.nycaviation.com/2019/01/how-existing-funding-could-keep-the-faa-open-in-a-future-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Rainey on NYCaviation</a>, the 7.5% tax on tickets does not apply to airline fees. Airline fees are those so-called &#8220;optional&#8221; add-ons such as checking a bag, changing a flight, or even selecting a seat. I find it curious that an industry which has taken such a liking to fees to suddenly lash out at airports for wanting the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">option</span> to make modest increases to their own. The hypocritical nature of airlines collecting less in taxes due to unbundling, while profiting from their own fees and attempting to deny airports funding is really quite incredible.</p>
<p>This hypocrisy is obvious. So much in fact that Airlines for America&#8217;s marketing program on Twitter prompted a severe backlash from the general public. Chipping in a few bucks to airports, it seems, isn&#8217;t the polarizing issue A4A had hoped it would be. A4A seems to have learned their lesson, and on June 6 pivoted their disinformation campaign away from <a href="https://twitter.com/airlinesdotorg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AirlinesDotOrg</a> to their less obvious <a href="https://twitter.com/stopairtaxnow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@StopAirTaxNow</a> account. From my perspective, hiding behind a less obvious account only proves the point that this isn&#8217;t a winning issue in the public eye.</p>

<h3>What do the airports have to say?</h3>
<p>It turns out that the airports have their own lobbying group, called the Airports Council International, (ACI). I reached out to Scott Elmore, VP of marketing and communications for the North American region, to get their take on A4A&#8217;s arguments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8220;The same airlines that have no issue charging fees for checked bags, seat assignments, and reservation changes are trying to block airports from making much-needed infrastructure upgrades. Despite what airlines say, America’s airports face $128 billion in infrastructure upgrades over the next few years. Anyone who has been in an airport recently can attest to that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While chatting with Scott and his PR representatives I presented the claims that A4A makes on their <a href="https://stopairtaxnow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StopAirTaxNow</a> site. Below are the A4A claims with the ACI-NA comment presented as they are. You be the judge&#8211; Is it too much to ask that airports be allowed the option to make modest increases to the PFC to help fund infrastructure? Or are the airlines right? Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Airlines:</strong> Customers are already paying $6.9 billion per year in airport taxes, helping airport revenues to soar to a record of nearly $30 billion.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> The cost of operating an airport is high. After airports cover their daily operating expenses there is little left for capital intensive infrastructure projects. In addition, airports are required to hold large cash reserves when they utilize the bond market to finance projects. Airports face almost $92 billion in debt right now to pay off past projects, and the borrowing costs are excessive thanks to a restricted PFC.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines:</strong> There is also almost $7 billion sitting in the aviation trust fund—that’s billions of dollars that can be spent on infrastructure instead of charging passengers more.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> The big airlines fall short of actually saying the unobligated balance in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund should go to airports. The trust fund – which is used to fund AIP grants, FAA facilities and equipment, and the air traffic control system – may enjoy a healthy balance today, but that has not always been the case. It would be irresponsible to bankrupt a trust fund that is so important to all of FAA’s activities.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines:</strong> Airport revenues are diverted off-airport every year – almost $5.4 billion in the past 10 years – money that could have been used for airport infrastructure.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> This is missing a lot of context. Congress has exempted 12 “port authorities” from the FAA’s revenue diversion rule because of the complexity of bond issuances for the handful of affected airports. In the case of these airports, it is the authority, state, or city that actually issues the bond, rather than the airport itself. Changing this standard – even for this small group of impacted airports – would have significant negative implications on the authorities as bondholders, could jeopardize billions of dollars of construction projects and thousands of jobs, and undo local financial agreements that have been in place for decades.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines:</strong> U.S. airports have $14.5 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on hand – roughly 381 days of liquidity.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> This is also missing context. Airports follow generally accepted accounting definitions when they complete the FAA Form 127, and have reported $14.2 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on hand as of the end of FY2016.  But that does not mean that simply because cash is characterized as “Unrestricted” it is available to be spent for any purpose, as the airlines mistakenly argue. It is important to understand that, in reality, only an estimated $2.3 billion is truly unrestricted and available for new capital projects, not the $14.2 billion claimed by the airlines.</p>
<p><strong>Airlines: </strong>Airports are investment-grade entities with ample access to the bond market. Strong credit ratings allow airports to access capital markets at preferred rates. All airports fall within the investment-grade ratings of AA±, A± and BBB±.</p>
<p><em>Airports:</em> There is nothing wrong with having investment grade credit-rating. That shows airports are prudently managing their financial situation. But that does not mean that airports have access to unlimited borrowing. All the debt needs to be paid back eventually. There needs to be steady revenue stream to back the bonds issued. If airports can’t show steady future revenue stream to pay back the debt, they are unable to borrow more. Borrowing also makes the projects more expensive. In some long-term bond issuance, the interest component can be higher than the cost for the project itself. The essence for borrowing is to push the cost into the future. Airport CFOs look at all financing options to optimize their capital structure.</p>

<h2><strong>Bound for Antarctica</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet quite 05:00 as the day begins for the crew. In Sydney, Flight Dispatch and Pete Dawson at QMET have already been busily gathering the latest data, which the crew can tell from the prompt that appears on their iPads. The flight plan and most recent weather forecasts are available, and everything seems in line with the detailed briefing of the day before.</p>
<p>As the bus moves through the dark and silent Sunday morning streets of Melbourne, Capt. Fitzgerald discusses the weather once again with QMET&#8217;s Peter Dawson on speaker as the rest of the crew listen in. The plan remains, and the route toward Cape Adare is confirmed for the best viewing while the land to the south towards McMurdo appears to have substantial cloud cover.</p>

<p>The glow of iPads is the only illumination as the bus makes its way to the airport. The latest briefing material has been uploaded as well as the flight plan, which includes an additional detail in its ATC flight strip: the maximum viewing time over Antarctica. By the time the crew is seated in the Domestic Terminal&#8217;s briefing room—yes, this is a domestic service—all of the information has been reviewed and the discussion fundamentally reinforces the anticipated plan and considers the critical differences of the Antarctic operation one more time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-55598" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-503x754.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-503x754.jpg 503w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-167x250.jpg 167w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/747-Cover-754x1131.jpg 754w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>The engineers call to advise that the Boeing 747-400 VH-OEG has been fueled to its maximum capacity of just over 178 tonnes, given the current specific gravity (SG) of the fuel. They also confirm that the aircraft has been fitted with the additional audio-visual equipment and that the paperwork has been completed.</p>
<p>Aside from the digital flight plan, there is additional paperwork to be completed for the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) in Hobart. AAD is the government department that approves Qantas to conduct these flights over Antarctica, based on environmental impact studies that Qantas supplies and logs that will be kept during actual flights. The Antarctic Flight Summary and Environment Log will be filled out in real time beyond 60 degrees South latitude and submitted to AAD post-flight.</p>
<p>The pilots then make their way down the hallway where Capt. Buddery addresses the cabin crew for the flight. There is a tangible level of excitement among the crew—a mix of senior flight attendants and relative newcomers who all share a common fascination with the flight that lies ahead.</p>
<p>With well over an hour until departure, the gate lounge is full of excited passengers ranging from school students to a pair celebrating their 90th birthdays. Each with a name tag on their chest and vying for a photograph with the Penguin mascot, there is no mistaking this for your everyday Regular Public Transport service. Even with a comfortable margin of time until the Boeing pushes back, the crew is busy readying the aircraft inside and out. This includes confirming the operation of the specially fitted entertainment system and that it is in working order throughout the cabin.</p>
<p>As the sun edges above the horizon in the east, the last door of the 747 is closed and all is ready for the journey southward.</p>
<div id="attachment_55602" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55602" class="size-medium wp-image-55602" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-754x566.jpeg" alt="Photo: Owen Zupp" width="754" height="566" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-754x566.jpeg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-250x188.jpeg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6280-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55602" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Owen Zupp</p></div>
<h2><strong>Flight of a Lifetime</strong></h2>
<p>At 406,000 kilograms (895,000 pounds), the aircraft is still more than 6,000kg (13,000lb) under its maximum takeoff weight. Under Capt. Buddery&#8217;s hand, it lines up on Melbourne&#8217;s Runway 34 and is given takeoff clearance. With the clearance confirmed by the entire crew, the thrust levers are advanced, and the four-engine giant begins to accelerate. At 173 knots, the Boeing is rotated, lifting its nose from the runway to start its climb into the morning sky.</p>
<p>The air is smooth as the four-hour sector to the ice begins. Extensive overcast lies below, and Tasmania only peeks through a break as the 747 passes overhead. Now comes a rare opportunity for the members of the crew to mingle with the passengers and answer a stream of questions about the 747 and the flight details. Interestingly, the pilots have questions of their own for the young PhD students from the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Stationed by one of the doors, the scientists have set up an array of equipment to conduct experiments relating to cosmic radiation and the earth&#8217;s magnetic field. And while they were impressed by the GPS&#8217;s read-out of over 300km/h during the takeoff roll, it’s another instrument that is particularly impressive: the ‘Dip Circle.&#8217;</p>
<p>Measuring around 15cm in diameter, the brass ring possesses a dual-face of glass with a needle inside. It resembles a large, see-through compass and is designed to measure the vertical component of a magnetic field, or ‘dip.&#8217; Made in the 19th Century, this piece of scientific craftsmanship has journeyed to Antarctica before, by boat in 1910.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that science takes its place onboard the Qantas aircraft as Australia’s association with research dates back to 1886, when an Australian Antarctic Committee was founded. Today, Australia has three permanent scientific research stations located in Australian Antarctic Territory: Mawson, Davis, and Casey. In total, there are 40 permanent research stations in Antarctica conducting valuable research under the truly international banner of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, or SCAR.</p>
<p>Enroute, a phone patch has been organized for Capt. Fitzgerald to interview the Casey Station Leader, Christine ‘Chris’ MacMillan, which is broadcast through the cabin. In a fascinating exchange, Chris informs the passengers on various aspects of life at an Antarctic Research Station. How the 120 crew is scaled back to just 30 in the winter months, the importance of working as a team, and recreational activities, which even include a dip into the icy waters on Australia Day.</p>
<p>With two hours remaining until we reach the Antarctic continent, the crew is busy with a range of duties. Critical fuel calculations and maximum viewing times are confirmed, contact is made with McMurdo Station, an updated briefing is obtained from QMet, and the latest QNHs are gathered from various bases in Antarctica. The most conservative QNH is chosen for altimetry purposes when the aircraft descends.</p>
<p>And that time is approaching.</p>

<h2><strong>Land Ho!</strong></h2>
<p>Passing 60 degrees south, the crew commences their additional logs, ensures that the topographical strip maps are at hand, and switches the 747’s heading reference from Magnetic to True as the deviation between the two becomes too great as we near the South Pole.</p>
<p>The cloud cover slowly starts to break up below and then, in the distance, are the jagged peaks of Antarctica. With the QNH, viewing time and critical scenarios double-checked, the aircraft begins its descent to a minimum safe altitude of 18,000 feet. McMurdo has advised that the LC-130 aircraft that was inbound has returned to Christchurch due to a technical issue, making the 747 the only aircraft in the area. Even so, reports are routinely made by CPDLC and broadcast on VHF radio.</p>
<p>Towering Mount Minto comes into view, and the sheer immensity of Antarctica becomes apparent. Landfall is made at Cape Adare as planned before we fly a short westbound leg, but it becomes evident that the meteorological team was correct and a cloud bank lies along that route. Turning back towards the Transantarctic Mountain Range, the view is spectacular, made the more so by the pristine air.</p>
<p>There are mountain peaks and razor-edged ranges, glaciers at every turn. Some are filled with reef-like lines of blue ice, which forms when snow falls on a glacier and becomes compressed, squeezing out air bubbles and allowing the ice crystals to enlarge. Beyond the coast, the water is partially covered by pack-ice with mammoth, mesa-like icebergs rising from the sea while their greater mass lurks below.</p>

<p>On the Thursday before the Labor Day long weekend, I had a one-hour ground session with an instructor who I&#8217;d seen around Galvin, but hadn&#8217;t worked with before. He asked me lots of questions about FAA regulations, Galvin&#8217;s house rules, where to find info about specific equipment required for airworthiness, and a bunch of stuff from the FAR/AIM (Federal Aviation Regulations / Aeronautical Information Manual), which is basically the bible for aviation regulations.</p>
<p>It went well; I&#8217;d expected an oral exam, but it was more of a conversation. I knew it would be open book, so I was allowed to look stuff up that I didn&#8217;t know, as there&#8217;s way too much stuff for anybody to possibly memorize. The important part is knowing where in the FAR/AIM to find the info.</p>
<p>I will confess to having been quite stressed out about all of this. I <em>really</em> wanted to succeed. The stress was all self-generated, but it was stress just the same. The folks at Galvin were patient and supportive and pretty much awesome. But I can&#8217;t remember ever being so nervous about an endeavor.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, I had a one-hour evaluation flight with yet a different instructor. On this flight, she told me her hope was to simply sit quietly and observe, not having to intervene in any way while I took us from the ramp out to one of the nearby practice areas, demonstrated whichever maneuvers she requested, fly back, and do three touch-and-gos, with a couple simulated emergency surprises tossed in along the way.</p>

<p>She&#8217;d be verifying that I could do the following without error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preflight the plane, including obtaining the weather briefing and related info</li>
<li>Get appropriate taxi clearance and correctly follow the instructions</li>
<li>Do the engine run-up and remaining preflight checklist items</li>
<li>Get takeoff clearance</li>
<li>Properly read back all ATC instructions and then properly follow said instructions</li>
<li>Take off and maintain proper altitudes and course headings (SEA&#8217;s Class B airspace extends over BFI, and Renton Municipal&#8217;s airspace abuts BFI&#8217;s to the southeast, so there&#8217;s no room for variances in altitude or heading)</li>
<li>Navigate to the practice area, and self-announce what I&#8217;m doing before I do it via the practice-area UNICOM frequency so other aircraft in the area know what I&#8217;m doing (everyone else in the practice area does this, too, so we all know who&#8217;s doing what, and where they&#8217;re doing it)</li>
<li>Perform the requested maneuvers &#8211; in this case, she asked me to demonstrate slow flight, slow turns, a power-on stall, and deal with a simulated engine fire</li>
<li>Return to BFI, getting the current weather on the way, communicating with ATC to get clearance to return to the airport for pattern work, maintaining proper airspace awareness and appropriate altitudes, pattern entry point, airspeeds, etc.</li>
<li>Do three touch-and-go landings, one without using flaps</li>
<li>Execute one go-around maneuver</li>
<li>Land, complete checklists, get taxi clearance, and return to the Galvin ramp</li>
</ul>
<p>There was some other stuff in there, too. It all went really well. The next morning would be my solo flight.</p>

<p>And what a day it was. Mostly clear skies with calm winds. August 31. In an awesome coincidence, it was also my beloved (and dearly departed) grandmother&#8217;s birthday, the woman who inadvertently started me on this path by simply trying to entertain two boys in a small Massachusetts town all those years ago.</p>
<p>My instructor accompanied me on the first two trips around the pattern (after all the normal preflight stuff, etc., of course). We then taxied back to the ramp, parked, and shut down the plane.</p>
<p>He got out, went through the formalities of verifying the validity of my student pilot certificate, my third-class medical certificate, and my photo ID before writing an endorsement in my logbook authorizing me to fly solo.</p>
<p>He smiled, wished me luck, and went to stand on the edge of the ramp to watch, holding an aviation radio, just in case I needed his help. This is referred to as a supervised solo.</p>
<p>Those first two warm-up laps really helped boost my confidence. The checklists took care of my remaining jitters, as they gave me plenty to do and, by checking off the items, reminded me that I actually was prepared for this.</p>

<p>OK. Let&#8217;s do this.</p>
<p>Get taxi clearance, and don&#8217;t forget to state that I&#8217;m a student pilot per the rules so ATC knows what&#8217;s up. Taxi to the hold area. Switch to tower frequency and get takeoff clearance, taxi onto the runway, line up on centerline. Slowly apply full power, being sure to add enough right rudder to keep the plane straight. Note when the airspeed indicator comes alive. At 55 knots, rotate.</p>
<p>The plane practically leapt off the ground, surprising me a tiny bit. I knew the performance would be better with only one person in the plane, but it was markedly better.</p>
<p>I climbed quickly to 700 feet, and made the crosswind turn into the pattern. I reached the pattern altitude of 1,000 feet as I was turning downwind, so I simultaneously throttled back and pitched down a bit to arrest the climb during the turn.</p>
<p>From there, I flew straight along the power lines until abeam the numbers at the end of the runway, visible to my left, all the while listening for ATC to issue me a landing clearance, then responding appropriately to the radio call. And then I went back to talking out loud to make sure I didn&#8217;t forget anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once abeam the numbers, reduce power to 1,500 rpm to start the descent. Below 110 knots, set flaps to 10˚. When we&#8217;re 45 degrees from the end of the runway, begin the crosswind turn. Once stabilized on the crosswind leg, set flaps to 20˚. Turn to final. Look at the glideslope indicator to the left of the runway to be sure I&#8217;m on the right glideslope.&#8221; One red and one white light is what I want. Two white means too high, two red means too low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set flaps to full. Keep the airplane on the extended runway centerline, correcting for any crosswind drift, crabbing into the wind as required. Continue to maintain glideslope. When close to the runway threshold, reduce power, eyes down the runway, perform the flare, set the plane down gently on the main gear.&#8221; Once the nose wheel is on the ground, slide your feet up the rudder pedals to press on the tops to switch to the wheel brakes and steering (you steer on the ground with your feet, not the yoke). Apply brakes to slow down, select a taxiway exit, turn off the active runway.</p>
<p>Come to a full stop with all parts of the aircraft across the the hold-position line. Complete the after-landing checklist. Don&#8217;t forget to breathe. Switch the radio back to ground frequency, request taxi clearance back to 14L.</p>
<p>Do this a total of three times.</p>
<p>Rolling out after the third landing, let out a whoop that&#8217;s so loud you almost deafen yourself via the mic in the headset. Stop, get taxi clearance. Laugh like a giddy fool the rest of the way to the ramp. Have a beaming instructor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_solo_flight">ruin a perfectly good T-shirt</a>.</p>

I now consider it a trophy.</p></div>
<p>What&#8217;s next? Another supervised solo, this time with touch-and-go landings instead of full-stop landings, then on to training with the instructor for soft- and short-field landings, and then cross-country flying and all the flight planning and navigation stuff that entails.</p>

<h3>Start of the Transition</h3>

<h3>Rouge: Air Canada&#8217;s newest gamble</h3>
<p>With their eyes on mainline expansion, Air Canada&#8217;s Leisure group became increasingly forgotten as costs started to exceed passenger demand. By 2012, something needed to be done. With Transat, WestJet Vacations, and Sunwing Travel dominating the &#8220;Snowbird Sector&#8221;, a creative, cost-effective solution became a necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus: </strong><em><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2013/07/air-canada-rouge-first-flight-of-a-new-leisure-airline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air Canada Rouge-First Flight of a New &#8220;Leisure&#8221; Airline</a></em></p>
<p>Enter Benjamin Smith, Air Canada&#8217;s President of Passenger Airlines. If Air Canada was to re-enter the leisure market, Smith realized they would need to reduce their labor and operational costs. However, this wouldn&#8217;t be easy. The bulk of Air Canada&#8217;s flight attendants and line pilots are currently members of a union group: <a href="https://cupe.ca/">CUPE</a> (Flight Attendants) or <a href="https://acpa.ca/">ACPA</a> (Pilots). Consequently, this made negotiating contracts extremely difficult. Also, history was not on Air Canada&#8217;s side.</p>
<h4>Tango and Zip: Learning from past mistakes</h4>
<p>Shortly after merging with Canadian Airlines, Air Canada launched two budget airlines to try and fend off WestJet and Canada 3000. <em>Tango</em> offered low-frill service between Air Canada&#8217;s main hubs (Trans-Con Operations) and flew &#8220;Snowbirds&#8221; down to the southern United States. Zip, on the other hand, primarily competed with WestJet, who at the time was dominating the low-cost sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_55135" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55135" class="size-medium wp-image-55135" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-754x433.jpg" alt="Air Canada Rouge A319 Taxiing at YVR" width="754" height="433" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-754x433.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-250x144.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCN4771-768x441.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55135" class="wp-caption-text">Operating a mixed fleet of A319s and 767s, Rouge expanded to Western Canada in 2014 &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>

<p>Ultimately, Tango ended up cannibalizing Air Canada&#8217;s mainline routes while Zip&#8217;s relatively high labor costs inhibited their ability to discount fares. Neither subsidiary had performed to the standards expected by the airlines&#8217; executives. Tango ceased flying in 2003. While the airline ceased operating, the brand remained as a fare class for the parent carrier. Zip, on the other hand, continued operating until September 2004 before terminating service for good. The brand has never resurfaced and Air Canada vacated the low-cost market.</p>
<h4>Domestic Expansion: Taking advantage of scope clauses</h4>
<p>In their return to the budget sector, Air Canada has struck gold with Rouge. Ben Smith managed to negotiate a fantastic deal for the parent company while also creating something &#8220;reasonably&#8221; fair for the pilots and flight attendants. The scope clauses negotiated have allowed the airline to expand in the domestic market without imposing on AC&#8217;s mainline network.</p>
<p>Crucially, Rouge offers Air Canada something that its Express brand can&#8217;t: lower costs with room for capacity growth. Over the past few years, we have seen this manifested in a couple of different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new cross-country services that were previously been uneconomical
<ul>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> <em><a href="https://ehviationblogger.wordpress.com/2017/12/21/hot-air-5-swiping-left-on-swoop-decembers-route-roundup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rouge expands service to Kamloops and Nanaimo</a> via EHviation</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Up-gauging Air Canada Express routes to &#8220;mainline&#8221; aircraft with higher capacity and lower <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/casm.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost per Available Seat Mile</a>. This also allows for additional cargo capacity.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To date, Rouge has been reasonably well-received by Canadians. Passengers are able to redeem their Aeroplan miles, connect through Air Canada&#8217;s global network (interline), and, for a fee, gain access to Air Canada&#8217;s <em>Maple Leaf Lounge.</em></p>
<p>With a long-term strategy in place, Rouge is well-positioned for future success.</p>
<h3>Flair Airlines: Turning over a NewLeaf</h3>
<div id="attachment_55239" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55239" class="wp-image-55239 size-medium" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-754x471.jpg" alt="Flair Air 737-400 arriving at YVR" width="754" height="471" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-754x471.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-250x156.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/017-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55239" class="wp-caption-text">Founded in 2005 as cargo/charter carrier, Flair Airlines incorporated virtual airline NewLeaf on July 25th, 2017 &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>
<h4>Origins and Context</h4>
<p>As we continue our look at Canada&#8217;s low-cost carriers, this is definitely the one that you haven&#8217;t heard of before. Perhaps the most interesting of the three, Flair Airlines, started operations in 2005 as a charter/cargo operator. Since rebranding and adopting a low-cost business model, Flair has carved out a niche in Canada&#8217;s domestic market. While they have achieved some success, Flair continues to face the most adversity. Without the support of a parent carrier, Flair is on its own against Canada&#8217;s domestic giants.</p>
<p>Based in Edmonton (AB), Flair&#8217;s mixed fleet of 737s is one of the oldest in Canada. With that in mind, the airline is currently in the process of replacing their -400s with leased -800s, something that will continue through 2020. As of right now, their closest competitor is WestJet&#8217;s subsidiary <em>Swoop</em>. While on paper they target the same subset of the market, the two carriers actually have very different networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_55238" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55238" class="size-medium wp-image-55238" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-754x462.jpg" alt="Flair Air 737 parked at YVR - Photo: John Jamieson" width="754" height="462" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-754x462.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-250x153.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736-768x470.jpg 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thumbnail_20190627_131736.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55238" class="wp-caption-text">Flair Air 737 parked at YVR &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>
<h4>Doing things Differently</h4>
<p>While Swoop may shout about their nine dollar fares, Flair is arguably doing more to drive down prices. Instead of serving secondary markets, they are trying to reduce fares between mainline destinations. If the carrier can withstand the short-term financial challenges, they have a chance to really establish themselves in the Canadian market.</p>
<p>Bucking the low-cost trend, Flair raised eyebrows when they chose to operate flights into Canada&#8217;s two largest airports: Vancouver (YVR) and Toronto (YYZ). When Flair began service between YVR and YYZ, they undercut both Air Canada and WestJet. While the two giants have since responded by slashing fares, Flair continues to operate direct service on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Flair is more in touch with Canadians than Swoop or Rouge: they provide low fares on routes that matter. While Swoop may offer more attractive destinations, Flair is sticking around thanks to the loyalty they&#8217;re showing to Canadians.</p>
<h3>Swoop: WestJet&#8217;s Canadian SPIRIT</h3>
<div id="attachment_55372" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55372" class="wp-image-55372 size-medium" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-754x432.jpg" alt="A Swoop 737-800 Parked at YXX" width="754" height="432" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-754x432.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-250x143.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/012-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55372" class="wp-caption-text">Established as a low-cost fighting brand, Swoop serves secondary markets and caters to millennials &#8211; Photo: John Jamieson</p></div>
<p>Following the demise and acquisition of Canadian Airlines, WestJet started drifting away from its low-cost roots. After quashing the hopes of Montreal-based start-up Jetsgo, WestJet set its sights on Air Canada. If you need a reminder of how the carrier transitioned from a friendly budget carrier to a profit-focused hybrid airline, check out our recent look at WestJet and its partnership with Delta.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus: <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2019/05/westjet-driven-forward-by-delta/">WestJet: Driven Forward by Delta</a></strong></p>
<p>In a twist of irony, especially given their new slogan, WestJet&#8217;s owners may &#8220;Love where they&#8217;re going&#8221; but Canada&#8217;s cost-sensitive travelers certainly don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>As WestJet moved closer to Air Canada, a chasm opened up beneath their wings. As they began spurning budget travelers, WestJet&#8217;s competitors began to take notice. Air Canada was the first to respond (Rouge), followed shortly by a new market entrant: Flair Air (through the acquisition of Newleaf). All of a sudden, WestJet&#8217;s role as a low-cost small-market carrier was in jeopardy. In order to re-establish its position in the low-cost realm, the airline needed a fighting brand with a charismatic, yet competent, individual running the show. Enter Steven Greenway and Swoop.</p>
<h4>Men at Work: the man from &#8220;Down Under&#8221;</h4>
<p>Hailing from Australia, Swoop&#8217;s inaugural President is a certified &#8220;AvGeek.&#8221; A longtime Boeing fan (with particular emphasis on the Queen of the Skies), Steven had the opportunity to fly on Cathay Pacific&#8217;s final 747 flight in 2016. Having worked for low-cost carriers <strong><a href="https://www.virginaustralia.com/eu/en/?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virgin Blue</a> </strong>(now Virgin Australia) and Singapore Airlines&#8217; ULCC<strong>, </strong>Scoot<strong>, </strong>he also knows a thing or two about low-cost operations and e-commerce.

<h3>Interview With Swoop&#8217;s President</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>John Jamieson (JJ): </strong>Hi Steven, thanks for taking the time to meet! We&#8217;re here in Abbotsford celebrating the recent expansion of their passenger terminal. For a low-cost airline like Swoop, how important is it to partner with a cost-friendly airport such as Abbotsford?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Steven Greenway (SG)</strong>: It&#8217;s incredibly important from our standpoint. Being able to operate into an airport with reduced landing fees and lower handling expenses, we&#8217;re able to pass those savings along to our passengers, while stimulating new traffic for the airport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>JJ</strong>: Are there any plans to base any aircraft or establish a crew hub at YXX?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SG: </strong>If all of our expansion plans fall into place, we hope to begin basing a couple of 737-800s at YXX later this year.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JJ:</strong> Has the airline looked at Abbotsford as a potential connecting hub for destinations to the United States?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SG: </strong>Currently, the costs associated with connecting flights don&#8217;t offset the potential revenue gains. While this may be re-examined in the future, solidifying our <em>Origin and Destination </em>(O&amp;D) network remains our number one priority.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JJ: </strong>Lastly, in October of 2018, we learned that Swoop is to be included in WestJet&#8217;s Transborder joint venture with Delta Airlines. Will the airline be actively involved in the &#8220;JV&#8221; (ie. interlining, shared ground equipment, new services)? and secondly, will there be new emphasis at Swoop as far as entering existing Delta markets in the United States?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SG: </strong>As far as our involvement in the Joint Venture is concerned, we&#8217;ve opted to explore the agreement&#8217;s secondary benefits as opposed to interlining and codesharing. In terms of Swoop exploring new markets in the United States, our primary focus will be on revenue and network scheduling. Additionally, considering the airports we operate from in Canada, we&#8217;ll need to determine if those markets can handle international arrivals.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>My Canadian LCC Conclusion: </strong></h3>
<p>Without having tried Flair or Swoop, I can&#8217;t comment on their level of service or the reliability of their operations. While both airlines have been through rocky patches, neither has been forced to make major network cuts. On the other hand, my sole experience with Rouge in 2016 was more or less like my recent experience with United Airlines: unremarkable. While Rouge has been the most successful Canadian LCC in recent years, their base fares remain above Flair and Swoop.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the success or failure of these three carriers rides on the back of middle-class families and millennials. If the airlines can successfully attract new customers and reduce the cost of domestic air travel in Canada, they may stand a chance of being more than a one-year wonder.</p>

<p>Wilcox has been spearheading advancement within the aviation industry since the beginning of his career, such as all-leather economy seats with built-in LiveTV systems at JetBlue, where he was a founding executive. Fast forward to 2016, Wilcox founded what is now JSX, a public charter company with the idea to give a super fast and convenient service to its customers. The company is known to serve travelers with “the best of private travel at not-so-private fares.”</p>
<p>The JSX team saw a need for cheaper and more convenient travel, and set out to fix it. “It’s cheaper now than it’s ever been in history to get from Point A to Point B on Planet Earth,” explains Wilcox. “Millions of people fly every year but one market, at least in this country, has been left behind: short-haul flights.” In the private business, people pay upward of $5,000 to fly from airports such as Oakland to Seattle with 1-2 persons on board. At JSX, the 30-person carrier semi-private jet offers one way tickets for roughly $200.</p>
<p>“That’s what we’re here to fix,” says Wilcox. “The premise is you show up 20 minutes before the flight, you get on and you go. We’re creating a joyfully simple experience, and something that our customers are really loving.”</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, JSX started flights from Seattle-Boeing Field to Oakland, two major tech hubs in the U.S., adding ease for business travelers.

<p>I will say that I was shocked by some of the numbers. On average, SFO sells about 10,000 plastic water bottles per day, and that equals 3,650,000 per year. No question that is A LOT of plastic and even if they are all recycled (saying they are being recycled), it is not a good thing for the environment. It actually makes me pretty sad so many people do not bring their own reusable bottles (my fiancé brings one for both of us and is always reminding me to hydrate). Conversely, that high number of bottles also shows there is A LOT of demand from people to drink water in plastic bottles. Is it fair to require passengers to use other options?</p>
<p>Sure, sure, getting a reusable plastic bottle is not that much to ask, and the airport is providing some other good options, including water in other packaging (like aluminum and glass). But how expensive will those be and how will that impact a family of four on a fixed budget? Will passengers accept the change? Should there be some line of convenience vs doing what's right, and is this new policy crossing it? Honestly, I don't know the answers. But let me share with you some of my thoughts and I hope that we have a good conversation in the comments...</p>

<div id="attachment_55460" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55460" class="size-medium wp-image-55460" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-754x566.jpg" alt="My paper straw that I got to try while flying through SFO last - Photo: David Parker Brown" width="754" height="566" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-754x566.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-250x188.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55460" class="wp-caption-text">My paper straw that I got to try while flying through SFO last time &#8211; Photo: David Parker Brown</p></div>
<p class="p1">I will say that I was shocked by some of the numbers. On average, SFO sells about 10,000 plastic water bottles per day, and that equals 3,650,000 per year. No question that is A LOT of plastic and even if they are all recycled (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/702501726/where-will-your-plastic-trash-go-now-that-china-doesnt-want-it">saying they are being recycled</a>), it is not a good thing for the environment. It actually makes me pretty sad so many people do not bring their own reusable bottles (my fiancé brings one for both of us and is always reminding me to hydrate). Conversely, that high number of bottles also shows there is A LOT of demand from people to drink water in plastic bottles. Is it fair to require passengers to use other options?</p>
<p class="p1">Sure, sure, getting a reusable plastic bottle is not that much to ask,<span style="color: #000000;"> and the airport is providing some other good options, including water in other packaging (like aluminum and glass). B</span>ut how expensive will those be and how will that impact a family of four on a fixed budget? Will passengers accept the change? Should there be some line of convenience vs doing what&#8217;s right, and is this new policy crossing it? Honestly, I don&#8217;t know the answers. But let me share with you some of my thoughts and I hope that we have a good conversation in the comments&#8230;</p>

<p class="p1">First, here is the official write up from the airport:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Airport tenants, vendors, and permittees may not provide or sell bottled water in containers that contain plastic or aseptic paper packaging, including in vending machines. Reusable water bottles, recyclable aluminum, glass and certified compostable water bottles can instead be provided or sold.</p>
<p class="p1">Bottled water is defined as drinking water in a sealed box, bag, can, bottle, or other container intended primarily for single-service use and having a capacity of one liter or less.  Drinking water includes purified water, mineral water, carbonated or sparkling water, and electrolyte-enhanced water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p1">SFO has been making positive strides forward with going green this year, and a big cheers to them. Back in March, they started encouraging vendors to use reusable food service ware, and can only give customers one-use items if they are certified compostable (i.e. made with paper, wood, or bamboo). During <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2019/04/pay-the-anxiety-away-flying-uniteds-first-class/">my recent flight through SFO</a>, I was able to try out some of these and I will say I am not a huge fan of using a paper straw. I actually rather use no straw vs paper, and I guess that is probably the point! I do not think it is that much of a sacrifice for the greater good and I am guessing that most passengers will not even notice or care.</p>
<div id="attachment_55479" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55479" class="size-medium wp-image-55479" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-754x683.png" alt="Approved water options that vendors can use after the ban goes into effect - Image: SFO" width="754" height="683" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-754x683.png 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-250x226.png 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM-768x696.png 768w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-08-at-10.08.26-AM.png 1212w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55479" class="wp-caption-text">Approved water options that vendors can use after the ban goes into effect &#8211; Image: SFO</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;">I will say when I was first looking into this, I wasn&#8217;t the biggest fan. People are going to notice the change and might care about 10,000 times per day. However, after seeing that SFO is not planning to leave passengers high and dry (man, I love puns), this might not be that bad of a transition and maybe they can pull it off without frustrating too many people. The list above are all the approved water products that vendors can offer &#8212; and there are a lot. You will see that they are either made of aluminum or glass. The airport also offers plenty of hydration stations (ie places where you can fill up your own bottle quickly), but hopefully there will be enough with the increased demand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe part of my hesitation is just being a grumpy old man saying “get off my lawn” (at the age of 38) and having a hard time with change. I am not trying to be that person. I really hope that this ends up working and makes a positive impact with the reduction of plastic. I just know that flying is a pretty stressful experience for most people (even AvGeeks) and trying to get water shouldn’t add to the stress. At the same time, the vendors will also need to make sure the new options remain cost effective. I was told that if the water bottle change is successful, the airport will be looking to also replace other drinks in plastic bottles like soda, teas, and juices (saying options for those products in different containers improve). I truly hope this transition is a success and can spread to other airports. Until then, I will optimistically watch from the sidelines.</span></p>

<p>The A330 has been a great international workhorse for airlines, but I have never gone out of my way to fly on one (okay, maybe domestically on Hawaiian once). &#8220;What&#8217;s the aircraft flying my route? An A330? OMG YES I LOVE THAT PLANE,&#8221; said no one ever.</p>
<p>Of course most passengers aren&#8217;t as concerned with the type of plane they are flying (yes, I know it is shocking to think there are people like that out there), but they are more concerned with the product. Although Delta has been upgrading the interiors of their 777s to the newest product, the A330neo is the first type that has the newest product coming from the factory. I hadn&#8217;t seen the updated interior yet, and even though this was going to be a short visit with the plane on the ground, I still excited to have an opportunity to get onto a plane!</p>

<h2>GETTING SET AT SEA-TAC</h2>
<p>I always love an airline event that doesn&#8217;t require me to get up at 3:00am. With this one, I just needed to be at the Delta counter at 10:30am and get my day pass, which of course is going into my AvGeek collection. You still get to go through security and it prompts fun questions from the TSA agents. &#8220;Uh, I am going to look at an airplane, but not fly anywhere, don&#8217;t worry, it is totally legit&#8221; (pretty close to my actual convo).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I made it through (otherwise this would be a very different story), and we headed to the buses to ride out to our A330-900neo, which was located next to Delta&#8217;s maintenance facility at the south side of the airport.</p>

<p>After de-busing (that is a thing), we walked through a hangar and saw a Delta Boeing 717. A few of us geeked out a bit. The funny part is one of the cameramen (not an AvGeek) started setting up his camera and a Delta employee was asking if they were going to push in the stairs for us to go in. Since a few of us AvGeek media types got so worked up over the plane, they thought this must have been the plane we were all there for. Nope. It just takes a long time to get AvGeeks to move through any airport facility. #sorrynotsorry</p>

<h2>WE ARRIVE TO THE DELTA AIR LINES AIRBUS A330-900neo</h2>
<p>As we walked up to the back of the A330neo, I was super excited to hear the APU going. Why? Because it was a really odd weather combo in Seattle: rain, sun, heatt, and humidity! It felt more like Atlanta than Seattle.</p>

<p>Most times when I am touring an aircraft like this, I first head to the back, and then make my way forward. This was no different! Here we go&#8230;</p>

<p>First stop was the galley in the rear of the aircraft. It was quite large. The plane we were on was being prepped to fly a scheduled passenger flight, so soon there was going to be plenty of food and drink.</p>
<p>I will mention again that we didn&#8217;t have a heck of a lot of time to tour the plane. Part of it was we spent a lot of time outside the plane (taking photos of the A330neo and of course that 717), and this plane needed to be prepped for people who mattered &#8211; customers. I really didn&#8217;t get to try out much of the product; I just sat, played a bit, asked a few questions, took a few photos, and kept on moving forward (I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on seeing the flight deck).</p>
<p>For cost comparisons that you will see below, I looked at some one-way fares from Seattle to Shanghai on the Delta Airbus A330-900neo between now and the end of the year. With the product really impressing me, I wanted to see how much it would actually cost to fly, so I figured I would share the numbers. I averaged those costs to give a basic comparison, but obviously check delta.com yourself before packing your bags!</p>

<h2>DELTA MAIN CABIN (aka economy)</h2>
<p>Next was the economy section, or as Delta calls it &#8220;<a href="https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/products-and-services/in-flight/main-cabin.html">Main Cabin</a>.&#8221; This is the place where the majority of passengers will fly&#8230; and honestly that is not a bad thing. The inflight entertainment (IFE) screens were large, and reacted quickly to my input. The seats were comfy for my quick sit, but probably not as comfy after a 10-hour flight. Of course with the A330, best to try and get one of the two seats on the edge because sitting in the middle, of the middle, with strangers will make your flight feel even longer. Not wanting to spend too much time in Delta Main Cabin, I kept moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta Main Cabin A330-900neo cost flight: $435</strong></p>

<h2>DELTA COMFORT+ (aka &#8220;premium&#8221; economy)</h2>
<p>The next product forward is <a href="https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/products-and-services/in-flight/delta-comfort-plus.html">Delta Comfort+</a>. This is really your standard economy seat, with some additional legroom. You also get a fun little extra pocket on the seat back, and a red swath on your seat. I will admit that the addition of red in the cabin actually adds a bit of class.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s a good time to mention that the aircraft has air vents!!! I love this. Too few international aircraft have them and as a guy who normally runs hotter, I like having some control of my temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta Comfort+ A330-900neo cost flight: $485<br />
</strong><em>compare that to $435 in Main Cabin</em></p>
<p>Hmm. Okay. So only $100 more for a round-trip ticket in Comfort+, I might actually be interested in that.</p>

<h2>Delta Premium Select (aka domestic first)</h2>
<p>Now we are talking! The Delta Premium Select seat is where I started perking up. I rarely pay extra for more legroom. It just doesn&#8217;t seem like a good purchase, even at 6&#8217;1&#8243;. What I do find helpful is width, especially at 250lbs. The <a href="https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/onboard-experience/delta-premium-economy.html">Delta Premium Select</a> product is the seat that took most of my time (even more than Delta One)&#8230; and that is a good thing.</p>
<p>The seat really felt like an updated and upgraded domestic first class seat. You have a better IFE screen, seat controls, and the ability to recline. With a 2-3-2 layout vs the 2-4-2 layout in the back of the (air)bus, that extra width really makes a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta Premium Select A330-900neo flight cost: $600<br />
</strong><em>compare that to $435 in Main Cabin and $485 in Comfort+</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Dang. Now, I don&#8217;t have lot of extra money to spend on airfare, but $330 more for a round trip ticket in Premium Select vs Main Cabin might be worth it. Or at least paying $165 coming back home (so I can sleep before going back to work).</p>

<h2>Delta One (aka business class)</h2>
<p>You have arrived. <a href="https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/products-and-services/in-flight/delta-one.html">Delta One</a> is the best of the best from Delta and that is saying something. I appreciate that every &#8220;window&#8221; seat actually gets easy access to the window &#8211; not always the case with today&#8217;s business &#8220;suites&#8221; &#8211; and those in the middle of the cabin can easily put down a wall to chat with their seat mate, or put it up and stay private. You have the most room, best controls, lie-flat seat, and even a little slider door to up your privacy level.</p>
<p><strong>Average Delta One A330-900neo flight cost: $3350<br />

<p>Hot damn that is a lot of money (but actually not a bad deal compared to other business class products)! But often it makes sense for passengers (or businesses) to shell out the money or miles to fly in Delta&#8217;s best product. Based on the extra cost, I think it makes Delta Premium Select even a better deal!</p>

<h2>Airbus A330-900neo Flightdeck (aw yea!!!)</h2>
<p>Had to make it to the very front of the plane, and I did! I was only able to chat with a Delta pilot for a small amount of time before I was given the bad news that our time on the plane was coming to an end.</p>

<h2>Final Delta Air Lines Airbus A330-900neo Thoughts</h2>
<p>After getting back to the terminal, we headed on over to the Delta lounge at the airport. I had never been and it was a nice place to sit down, talk airplanes, and think a bit about the A330neo. I was impressed. I think the first time that I fly on a Delta A330-900neo will be the first time I am legitimately excited to fly on an Airbus A330, and maybe (just maybe) I can say that the airline/aircraft combos has become one of my favorites. Maybe.</p>

<p>There have been a couple of flights like that.</p>

<p>My most recent flight, however, was a great morale booster. It was a glorious Seattle afternoon &#8211; crystal-clear skies, mostly smooth air, and the wind was blowing straight down the runway. We flew to the Tacoma Narrows Airport (TIW), a lovely tower-controlled field on a bluff near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge">Tacoma Narrows Bridge</a> and phenomenal views of Puget Sound and the mountains.</p>
<p>And it was there that I became convinced that I finally have a handle on landings. I made five of them in the pattern, and all five were good &#8211; a couple were actually really good. Carl, my instructor, said he didn&#8217;t touch the controls once during any of them. It was a great feeling. The landing back at BFI was also pretty good.</p>
<div id="attachment_55396" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55396" class="size-medium wp-image-55396" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190721_8694-754x503.jpg" alt="Tacoma Narrows Airport is in the foreground, Tacoma Narrows Bridge is in the middle, and Mount Rainier is in the distance.

<p>Handling the radios for the different towers, maintaining clearance from Sea-Tac&#8217;s overlying class B airspace, recognizing landmarks for checking in with the control towers, correctly reading back their instructions, and then following them while performing the required pre-landing checklist items, and then following pattern protocols and landing procedures (i.e., flying the plane), all went pleasingly well.</p>
<p>Now if I can only consistently repeat all of that, plus all the required stage check maneuvers, I&#8217;ll be well on my way toward being qualified for solo flight.</p>
<p>Until then, it&#8217;s practice, practice, practice.</p>

Look up a tail number for any commercial aircraft, on a site like FlightRadar24, and you’ll find a long list of destinations. For widebody aircraft, those destinations get noticeably more far-flung. While many aircraft have a rich history, few have made an impact like the MD-10 known as N330AU - also known as the Orbis Flying Eye Hospital. This is not just any 'ol commercial or cargo aircraft, it provides some very special services. </p>
<p>Val Suberg, Orbis’ senior manager of aircraft maintenance, can prove that point with just one story about two sisters from Ethiopia. They were blind as a result of pediatric cataracts, which would be a simple surgery in many countries. The sisters, though, had traveled to Addis Ababa and found out that the hospital there only served adults. A member of the hospital staff told them that the Orbis Flying Eye Hospital would arrive in a few weeks, and that they could treat the sisters. They waited in Addis Ababa and were selected for surgery. They got to see each other for the first time, and were eventually able to attend college.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what fascinates me when I visit an airport is wondering where the aircraft have been. Look up a tail number for any commercial aircraft, on a site like <a href="http://www.flightradar24.com">FlightRadar24</a>, and you’ll find a long list of destinations. For widebody aircraft, those destinations get noticeably more far-flung. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many aircraft have a rich history, few have made an impact like the MD-10 known as N330AU &#8211; also known as the <a href="https://www.orbis.org/en/what-we-do/flying-eye-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbis Flying Eye Hospital</a>. This is not just any &#8216;ol commercial or cargo aircraft, it provides some very special services. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Val Suberg, Orbis’ senior manager of aircraft maintenance, can prove that point with just one story about two sisters from Ethiopia. They were blind as a result of pediatric cataracts, which would be a simple surgery in many countries. The sisters, though, had traveled to Addis Ababa and found out that the hospital there only served adults. A member of the hospital staff told them that the Orbis Flying Eye Hospital would arrive in a few weeks, and that they could treat the sisters. They waited in Addis Ababa and were selected for surgery. They got to see each other for the first time, and were eventually able to attend college. Now that is a special plane, with some VIP crew!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the impact we can have,” Val said. “I had 31 years at Fedex before I came here and that was a good job. They support Orbis with a lot of things including the donation of this airplane. But as an aircraft mechanic, there’s not a lot much you do to give back. So my little part of taking care of the airplane is my way of helping Orbis fulfill its mission.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-55415" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-754x503.jpg" alt="" width="754" height="503" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-754x503.jpg 754w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-250x167.jpg 250w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20180726_5043-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Val is one of Orbis’ full-time staff members. Its medical professionals and pilots, though, are all volunteers. Many of the pilots work for FedEx, which also flies MD-10 aircraft and donated N330AU to Orbis. The Flying Eye Hospital was at Phoenix Goodyear Airport for nearly two months undergoing a Heavy C Check during the spring of 2018. The Orbis team opened the aircraft for AirlineReporter and explained some of the features that make 330AU one of the most-interesting aircraft in the sky. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The current aircraft is the third Orbis Flying Eye Hospital.</strong> </span></h2>
<div style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg/640px-N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg"><img class="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg/640px-N220RB_Douglas_DC-8_Orbis_%287181096463%29.jpg" alt="Orbis DC-8" width="637" height="425" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This DC-8 is the original Orbis Flying Eye Hospital &#8211; Photo: Aeroprints.com via Wikimedia Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Orbis aircraft was a DC-8, which was succeeded by a DC-10. Orbis received N330AU from FedEx in 2008, and it took nearly eight years to convert it from freighter to flying eye hospital.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There’s an interesting story behind the aircraft’s tail number: Let’s start with the “AU” part of it.</strong> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That stands for Al Ueltschi, who was the personal pilot of Juan Trippe. He’s considered among the more-influential minds of modern flight training, and even founded FlightSafety International. As for the 330 part of the registration, that follows the pattern of the first two Orbis aircraft. The DC-8 was N110AU and the DC-10 was N220AU (which is on display at the Pima Air Museum).</span></p>
<h2><strong>Most medical aircraft are transports, but N330AU is certified as an actual hospital.</strong></h2>

<p>The aircraft travels with equipment to provide ground power. It can even convert local water sources to hospital-grade water using an onboard filtration system. The hospital section of N330AU is built from modular units that can be removed to convert it back into a freighter. The units could also be moved to another aircraft; Orbis expects to operate N330AU for 10-15 years.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This area doubles as a classroom, complete with a large-screen TV at the front. There’s also a galley. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of galleys, the original galley has been transformed into a maintenance bay and office. FedEx removed the plane’s original elevator and replaced it with a staircase/ladder. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The hospital equipment and other gear make N330AU a heavy aircraft.</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not in the typical callsign “heavy” way &#8211; heavy in actual weight. Because of the extra weight, it usually doesn’t fly more than eight hours at a time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgeries aboard the Flying Eye Hospital take up to four times longer than the same procedure performed elsewhere. That’s because the Orbis volunteer medical professionals use each surgery as a teaching opportunity. They help local medical professionals sharpen their skills and enhance their knowledge.</span></p>

<h3>American Air MD-80 Fleet Detail</h3>
<p>Despite a reputation for being old and dated, the average fleet age for those which remain is just shy of 21 years. That&#8217;s not terribly old in aircraft years. Aviation history buffs might recall that the <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2014/01/saying-goodbye-dc9-final-scheduled-flight-delta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final DC-9 flight operated by Delta</a> was aboard a nearly 36-year-old airframe.</p>
<p>Just 28 American Air MD-80s remain in service today. Two (<span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;N9618A&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:14915,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;9&quot;:1,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:30898},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;arial, sans, sans-serif&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}">N9618A and N980TW) will retire in August. Between 1997 and 1999 TWA accepted delivery of all but one of the remaining silver birds. N501AA is special and sticks out for two reasons. First, it is the last active Super 80 which American received directly from McDonnell Douglas. It is also the oldest with a delivery date of October 30, 1989.</span></p>

<h3>Book your farewell flight today</h3>
<p>We reached out to American Air PR and chatted with resident MD-80 expert Linda Brock who provided us with fleet details and some base-level guidance on where folks might still find MD-80 service. Above is a map showing city pairs with MD-80 service on the September 4, the final day of operation. A few additional cities still have MD-80 service to DFW, including my home base here in Kansas City, MO.</p>
<p>If your favorite city pair isn&#8217;t listed, perhaps a quick search on <a href="http://flightradar24.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlightRadar24</a> or simply looking at equipment listed on AA&#8217;s booking page can help.</p>
<p>Big takeaway here? DFW is where it&#8217;s at. Does anyone fancy a trip to Dallas for old time&#8217;s sake?</p>

<p>The lounge is huge &#8211; 15,800 square feet. Window walls provide views to the west and north, encompassing the runways, the Olympic Mountains beyond, and the tops of the downtown Seattle skyscrapers, all weather permitting, of course &#8211; Seattle is famous for its persistent cloud cover.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s it like? It&#8217;s shiny new, and, while not in the same league as, say, Singapore&#8217;s epic Changi airport, it&#8217;s perfectly Pacific Northwest in scale and vibe.</p>

<p>Once Alaska opens its newest lounge at San Francisco International Airport, it will have a total of eight lounges systemwide, and will have invested $50 million on a combination of new construction and renovations in Seattle, Los Angeles, Portland, and New York JFK.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a large fireplace-centric seating area for relaxing, and plenty of smaller spaces for work or for trying to get a bit of quiet time between flights. The bar offers something close to a dozen microbrews, the coffee bar slings lattes all day long, along with scones and tea for those with a more British bent.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Delta raised the bar at Sea-Tac with a large, two-story glass-fronted lounge; this totally evens the score, offering far better views.</p>

<p>With the huge increases in passengers volumes at Sea-Tac Airport — it&#8217;s grown from handling 30 million passengers in 2010 to 50 million in 2018 — the additional, comfortable space has arrived none too soon.</p>

<p>Simple, fast, efficient, comfortable, and reasonably-priced air travel. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>JetSuiteX kicked off scheduled service between Seattle and Oakland, Calif., on July 1, with three flights per day between the two cities.</p>
<p>This means that the metro Seattle area now has three airports offering scheduled passenger service: Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA); Paine Field (PAE) in Everett; and Boeing Field (officially King County International Airport, BFI).</p>
<p>The airline euphemistically referred to the route as the &#8220;nerd bird&#8221; in a press release, no doubt calling out their hoped-for clientele: business travelers between the two tech hubs.</p>
<div id="attachment_55154" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55154" class="wp-image-55154 size-full" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6532-2.jpg" alt="No fuss here - you just walk out of the terminal building and onto your plane" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6532-2.jpg 750w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6532-2-250x167.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55154" class="wp-caption-text">No fuss here &#8211; you just walk out of the terminal building and onto your plane (for the curious, that&#8217;s a GOL B-737 MAX 8 on a test flight in the background)</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll soon have a separate story offering background on the airline and more on their plans for routes, so I&#8217;m going to focus primarily on the flying experience here. And what an experience it was.</p>
<p>Arguably, one of the best parts of flying with JetSuiteX isn&#8217;t the flight itself so much as the removal of pre- and post-flight hassles. Lines? Not really. There are only a maximum of 30 people on your flight, and you&#8217;re either flying out of a relatively quiet secondary airport or an executive-style FBO (fixed base operator) at a major airport.</p>
<p><span id="more-55141"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_55147" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55147" class="size-full wp-image-55147" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6484-2.jpg" alt="Boarding is a simple and quick process" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6484-2.jpg 750w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6484-2-250x167.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55147" class="wp-caption-text">Boarding is a simple and quick process</p></div>
<p>TSA? Nope. They&#8217;re below required passenger minimums for that, operating under Part 135 charter operator certificate, on aircraft with 30 or fewer seats, exempts them from many TSA requirements. I asked the airline about their safety protocols; below is their reply, verbatim:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>At JetSuiteX, the safety and security of our customers and crewmembers is always our number one concern. Any customer over the age of 18 will be required to show valid government issued photo ID or two alternate forms of identification with at least one issued by government authority. JetSuiteX has also implemented several additional controls that far exceed the TSA requirements and norms of the industry, to include ETD screening and the same TSA background check system used by the major airlines. JetSuiteX is proud to be the leader within semi-private travel in using these measures. Regulators at the TSA, FAA, and DOT have approved all JetSuiteX security measures, and we have deep cooperative relationships with local law enforcement. We also have various other, unseen mitigations constantly at-work behind the scenes.</em></p>
<p>So, simply because passengers don&#8217;t have to deal with the formal TSA processes does not mean there isn&#8217;t any security; it&#8217;s just that the security is done in a different way because of the small number of passengers on a given flight.</p>
<p>In that vein, the airline suggests checking in a mere 20 minutes before your scheduled departure time, which harkens back to the glory days of air travel. I was even able to park all day for free right in front of the terminal (word is that Boeing Field will start charging for parking at some point, so that perk likely won&#8217;t last long).</p>
<p>In Seattle, Boeing Field is just five miles south of downtown, adding to the convenience factor for business travelers working in the city.</p>
<p>Alex Wilcox, JetSuiteX co-founder and CEO (he was also one of the founders of JetBlue), said that these things alone can shave three or four hours from a standard round trip flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we&#8217;ve managed to screw up short haul travel,&#8221; Wilcox said, explaining that people don&#8217;t mind getting to the airport a two or three hours early for a 10+ hour flight, but not for a 90-minute flight. So, he said, those travelers either look for other options, such as driving, or just skip the trip altogether.</p>
<p>JetSuiteX uses a fleet of Embraer ERJ135s. Candidly, the only time I&#8217;d flown on one before was on a feeder airline in the upper Midwest. It had about 37 seats and felt like being in a sardine can, so I was curious as to how comfortable the trip would actually be.</p>
<p>Turns out, my concerns were unfounded. Business-class seats, and only 30 of them, made for plenty of personal space in the relatively small cabin. I could even stand up straight in the lavatory (the planes have one lavatory, all the way aft), something that&#8217;s not even possible on some larger jetliners.</p>

<p>For the flight from BFI-OAK, we left within 10 minutes of scheduled departure, with the tardiness mostly due to the inaugural celebration.</p>
<p>That delay was inconsequential, and was only worth mentioning because everything else went off like a Swiss watch.</p>

<p>At the BFI terminal, a newly-redecorated lounge welcomed us with big windows overlooking the ramp, and free coffee and snacks were available. I didn&#8217;t spend any time in there, though, because what AvGeek would pass up an opportunity for some ramp time to sit in a lounge, even a comfy one?</p>
<p>The flight took about 90 minutes to cover the 675 miles between Seattle and Oakland. Did I mention that the fare was only $99 each way? Sure, you can find cheaper sale fares with the major carriers, but then we&#8217;re back to the original conundrum of having to get to the airport at least 90 minutes early for your flight, etc., which effectively doubles the transit time for a round-trip flight.</p>

<p>And those cheap mainline fares get you the cheap mainline seats; JetSuiteX&#8217;s service is comparable to any domestic premium-economy product I&#8217;ve experienced, and is every bit as good as some domestic first class offerings, especially when comparing apples-to-apples on short-haul routes. BFI-OAK is currently JetSuiteX&#8217;s longest route. You can even earn JetBlue air miles on these flights.</p>
<p>There are no overhead bins in the small cabin, but the business-class sized seats have tons of room underneath for computer bags and the like. Everything else gets checked &#8211; you get a baggage allowance of two bags with a combined total of up to 50 lb. For this quick out-and-back trip I brought only the camera backpack I normally use for international travel, and had no problems fitting it under the seat &#8211; there&#8217;s more room than most domestic economy seats.</p>
<p>Is there onboard WiFi? Sort of, and it&#8217;s scheduled to improve. The onboard network is currently named something along the lines of GoGoTextOnly, and that network name pretty much explains the deal.</p>
<p>The WiFi is fast enough for texting, mostly. Even texting was slow, and forget about texting anyone a photo while in flight — the in-flight photo I texted to a friend as a test didn&#8217;t get sent until after we landed and my phone connected to a cellular network.</p>
<p>That said, things are slated to improve later this year. According to a JetSuiteX spokesperson, the company is working with SmartSky Networks to implement next-gen, ground-speed onboard WiFi. Originally planned to be launched in late summer, it’s been delayed until Q4 2019.</p>

<p>Once in California at Signature&#8217;s Oakland terminal, the vibe was more upscale bus station than airport; it was loud, there weren&#8217;t enough seats, and lots of people seemed determined to make messes faster than the very busy staff could get things cleaned up.</p>
<p>Free coffee, soft drinks, and light snacks were available, but, unlike BFI&#8217;s surprisingly good cafeteria in the main building, there are no easily-accessible food options at either the FBO or on that side of the Oakland airport. Granted, this isn&#8217;t meant to be a hang-out place, it&#8217;s meant for quick transfers, but soda and pretzels only go so far.</p>
<p>Uber Eats nicely solved the problem — I had Indian food delivered within 30 minutes during my two-hour layover.</p>
<p>On the outbound leg I was in the middle of the plane in seat 5C, a window. For the return, I was in 10B, an aisle seat in the very last row. The aft-mounted engines made for an unsurprisingly louder ride in the back, but despite that I was still able to carry on a pleasant conversation with the person seated next to me for much of the trip.</p>

<p>There is one flight attendant on the plane and an appropriately small galley, so the in-flight service consisted of beverages and packaged snacks, perfectly appropriate for such a short flight.</p>
<div id="attachment_55150" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55150" class="size-full wp-image-55150" src="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6506-2.jpg" alt="A peek at the ERJ135 flight deck" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6506-2.jpg 750w, https://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fpz_20190701_6506-2-250x167.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55150" class="wp-caption-text">A peek at the ERJ135 flight deck</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely a fan of this type of flying. There&#8217;s lots to like: prices that are competitive with the major airlines, no long TSA lines, quick and easy check in, comfortable lounges, and solid in-flight service.</p>
<p>The only drag is they only currently have one route out of Seattle.</p>

<p>Airports across the U.S. are recognizing the value in opening up and partnering with local aviation enthusiasts (<a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/?s=avgeek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AvGeeks</a>.)  We have been delighted to recognize, encourage, and report on this trend. To that end, AirlineReporter recently featured <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2019/02/louisville-tampa-airport-community-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two airports looking to forge relationships</a> in their own unique ways. How can we tell that this is indeed a trend rather than a few random events? Now, even airports known for being aggressive are looking to thaw relations. While this should not come as a surprise to locals or anyone who has recently tried PlaneSpotting in the area, it&#8217;s worth stating: The St. Louis airport has a well deserved, longstanding spot in the &#8220;AvGeek unfriendly&#8221; category.</p>
<p>But the airport&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stlavday&amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#STLavDay</a> event suggests that may very well be changing.</p>

<h3>STLavDay- Ahem, that&#8217;s the abbreviation for STL aviation day, thank you very much.</h3>
<p>The airport clearly put a lot of effort into planning what turned out to be an impressive inaugural event&#8230; Tongue-in-cheek questionable hashtag/abbreviation aside. In chatting with STLavDay organizers, interest in the invite-only event was strong. Just twenty-one attendees were selected from a much larger pool. To be considered, folks would participate in a sort of contest sharing photos and/or answering a few questions relating to their aviation interest. To their credit, the airport advertised the event on their various social media channels and the contest ran for at least a week. AirlineReporter attended without participating in the contest. However, we received equal treatment as those who went through the formal process. Additionally, we cared for our own travel and lodging.</p>

<h3>Meet and greet</h3>
<p>We arrived to the airport just before 10 AM and followed signage to what we discovered was an unused bit of former airport terminal.</p>
<p>BONUS: <a title="Urban Exploration: Kansas City International’s Shuttered Terminal A" href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2017/08/urban-exploration-kansas-city-internationals-shuttered-terminal/">URBAN EXPLORATION: KANSAS CITY INTERNATIONAL’S SHUTTERED TERMINAL A</a></p>
<p>After passing various checkpoints we arrived at two smiling faces welcoming us to the inaugural event. Upon signing in, we received wristbands and lanyard credentials featuring our social media handles. (Nice touch, by the way.) The next thirty minutes consisted of boilerplate safety briefings and getting to know our fellow AvGeeks.</p>
<p>I expected that my wife and I would be those who had traveled farthest (from the other side of the state) but it turned out the airport had attracted attention from a wide geographic area. One participant was from Kansas, another from San Antonio, and a few other non-locals thrown in for good measure. The fact that attendees were willing to travel from multiple states should be a clear sign to STL and others within their peer group having a less-than-friendly disposition towards PlaneSpotters and AvGeeks: <strong>AvGeeks travel for access.</strong> Embrace their added <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2015/12/understanding-the-current-debate-over-airport-passenger-facility-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PFC dollars</a> and padding of enplanement numbers while adding crucial eyes on the airfield.</p>

<h3>Behind-the-scenes at baggage handling</h3>
<p>Our first tour stop was in a baggage handling room. I have been exceedingly fortunate to have the opportunity to visit a number of baggage systems over the years. If you have seen one, you have seen them all: A labyrinth of conveyor belts transporting bags here and there. We <a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineReporter/status/1139919219385163777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted on Twitter</a> that photos weren&#8217;t allowed which resulted in an aggressive response from one fellow enthusiast. I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise mention it, but there is an important lesson here. Yes, the &#8220;no photos&#8221; rule seems silly (no other airport we&#8217;ve visited had such a rule) however, house rules matter. STL is dipping their toes in opening up here. We need to be accepting of airports where they are, and slowly nudge them along.</p>
<p>A bright spot of the baggage room was a TWA sticker we spotted still in place from the late 1990s. The revision date was February 1997. Cool! (We received special clearance for this one photo.)</p>

<p>BONUS: <a title="My Day as a [Mock] Airline Accident Victim" href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2015/07/my-day-as-a-mock-airline-accident-victim/">MY DAY AS A [MOCK] AIRLINE ACCIDENT VICTIM</a></p>
<p>While STL is not alone in having a mobile command bus, this was the first I have seen with my own eyes. Once onboard STL&#8217;s totally repurposed passenger bus we met with STL&#8217;s resident emergency management expert. Upon boarding, we were walked through what made this command center extra special. STL&#8217;s is a unique supplement to the airport&#8217;s emergency management plan. All of the walls are comprised of a magnetic whiteboard material for ease of jotting notes. There are multiple stations onboard for liaisons from various supporting departments. Hanging from the ceiling or on walls were screens showing real-time data as well as video pumped in from cameras mounted atop a telescoping antenna.</p>
<p>The airport was pleased to note that while the bus has proven handy during training missions, there has yet to be a real-life incident requiring its use.</p>

<h3>Touring operations</h3>
<p>Our next stop was atop a spiral staircase to a large windowed room; Airport Operations &#8211; consider it the &#8220;nerve center&#8221; of the airport. &#8220;Ops&#8221; agents as they tend to be called are tasked with monitoring various data feeds, coordinating with numerous departments, and having an on-the-ground presence for a litany of manual tasks around the airport. During our visit the ops team was discussing bird strikes, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/06/bird-strikes-airplanes-wildlife-federal-aviation-administration-data-sully-sullenberger/2613893002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a serious problem</a> that plagues airports. Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miracle on the Hudson</a>? This is why wildlife management in areas where aircraft operate is important. While with ops we learned about catch-and-release programs, and the complex process around reporting and cataloging birdstrikes. Did you know if the species of bird cannot be identified, a sample is sent to the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/wildlife/smithsonian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithsonian</a>?</p>

<h3>Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF)</h3>

<p>The third stop on our STLavDay tour was one of STL&#8217;s two firehouses. Given the &#8220;long&#8221; layout of STL&#8217;s airfield, just one firehouse would not allow for appropriate response times to all areas. Solution? Build another firehouse! Two (or more) firehouses isn&#8217;t uncommon at larger airports, but this setup is unique enough to note for a midwest operation.</p>
<p>A hand-full of AvGeeks were happy to climb aboard and learn all about the unique equipment and approach required for airport and aircraft-related fires.</p>

<h3>PlaneSpotting from the field</h3>
<p>For all of the planning and effort that the airport crew invested in other aspects of STLavDay, the most well-received stop along the tour was the opportunity to catch some traffic from the middle of the airfield. Jeff Lea, STL&#8217;s public relations manager, asked if we wanted to get some spotting in from a unique vantage point. Every face lit up as a result. While there was no traffic of particular interest, the opportunity to snap photos with the terminals and tower in the background was certainly a special treat. We spent what must have been at least thirty minutes spotting, although it only felt like a few before we loaded up the tour bus and were taken back to the terminal for one last treat.</p>
<h3>Meet and greet with STL&#8217;s director, Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge</h3>
<p>Upon arriving back to the terminal we were greeted by STL&#8217;s number one in command, Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge. While we enjoyed a catered lunch, Hamm-Niebruegge discussed her incredible tenure in aviation prior to becoming the airport&#8217;s leader. Past roles of AvGeek interest include time with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozark_Air_Lines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ozark</a> and later TWA.</p>
<p>Hamm-Niebruegge discussed in detail how STL airport is governed and financed. While I found it to be interesting, I got the impression fellow enthusiasts had lost interest. Part of the presentation detailed the incredible transformation and cost-cutting efforts the airport was forced to undertake when TWA left and traffic plummeted.</p>
<p>Other topics of note included the loss of trans-Atlantic service when Wow pulled out, and active interest to find a new partner to fill that vacancy. Hamm-Niebruegge also shared that the now long-term grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft has directly impacted her airport&#8217;s operations and growth aspirations. A few days prior to STLavDay, the airport was informed that a planned new Southwest route had been indefinitely tabled given fleet constraints resulting from the 737 MAX grounding.</p>

<h3>STLavDay- Conclusion</h3>
<p>All good things start with a first step. STLavDay was the first step in thawing relations with the aviation enthusiast community. The event was well executed. And judging by the reception of others, it was well received. These events take a lot of planning and effort. It is my sincere hope that the organizers saw a clear return on investment in their first major foray into airport community engagement.  For all of my travels, this is the first in which an airport director set aside time for a large group of enthusiasts on a Saturday afternoon. Well done to all and best wishes on future success.</p>

<p><em>This is a continuation of my multi-part series on learning to fly. <a href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/tag/fly-with-francis/">You can read the whole Fly With Francis series here</a>.</em></p>
<p>I passed the FAA written exam two weeks ago. I&#8217;ve never been so excited about what amounts to a B+ on a test. But it was a solid pass, as a 70 (or the equivalent of either a C or C-, depending on where you&#8217;re from) is the minimum required.</p>
<p>Those free online practice tests are really helpful for exam prep, but I credit the combination of dedicating tons of spare time to studying, along with all of the knowledge and tips shared by Robin, our most excellent ground instructor.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t just toss the books after the exam, though &#8211; keeping on top of this stuff seems to be a never-ending task, as several more exams of differing complexity await, as well as a series of so-called stage checks. These are flight-skill milestones, the first of which is probably the most daunting — stage 1, which, if successful, sets you up to do your first solo flight, and the checkride done with a different CFI for both safety and evaluative reasons.</p>

<p>For the longest time, I&#8217;ve been struggling with overcontrolling the plane at the last few seconds of the landing process. The idea is to do the approach lined up on centerline and staying on the glideslope, which I at least feel like I&#8217;ve got a decent handle on.</p>
<p>As the plane gets to the last few feet above the runway, you&#8217;re supposed to catch the descent and settle into ground effect, which is, basically, a situation in which the plane is sort of floating on a cushion of air something less than one wingspan above the ground. From there, you set the plane down smoothly on the main wheels, and fly the plane down the runway to a point where the wings are no longer generating enough lift to fly and the plane settles to the runway.</p>

<p>Practice makes perfect, though, and over the past few flights it finally feels like I&#8217;m starting to get the hang of things, at least now recognizing the point at which the plane enters ground effect and understanding a bit better about how gently (or, frustratingly, how not gently) to handle the controls.</p>
<p>That, and steering the plane to centerline with the rudder and not the control yoke. The instinct to steer the plane with the yoke is hard to overcome for someone used to driving a car &#8211; &#8220;steering&#8221; with the yoke activates the ailerons, dipping one wing and causing the plane to actually veer farther off course. Frustrating, and a bit confusing when all sorts of stuff is going on during the last bit of the approach.</p>
<p>Speaking of frustrating, then there&#8217;s the radio. Talking with ATC while still getting the hang of the whole flying thing, and having to both accurately understand and read back their instructions, still causes a bit of fluster for me. Apparently it&#8217;s also not an uncommon issue &#8211; Carl often just smiles and shrugs after he has to jump in and correct my botched radio calls.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also visited a few new airports &#8211; Tacoma Narrows (TIW), Bremerton (PWT), and Paine Field (PAE). I&#8217;m also in possession of the initial paperwork (read: more written tests) to begin the solo process, something that I&#8217;m oddly simultaneously excited and terrified about.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all part of the fun, I suppose.</p>
