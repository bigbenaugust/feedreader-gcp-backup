<p>The Association of American Universities conducted the survey in the spring of 2019 and found 35 percent of women undergraduates at UNC have experienced some form of unwanted sexual touching or assault. The number rises to nearly half having such experiences when the women undergraduate students who have been in college four or more years were polled.</p>
<p>Respondents to the survey also said 72 percent of the offenders were also students at UNC and that only 17 percent contacted a resource or program after their unwanted experience.</p>
<p>UNC’s history with addressing sexual assault and harassment is a long and difficult one. While the university has made many efforts to <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/new-task-force-brings-unc-leaders-together-to-tackle-sexual-assault-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve its policies</a> and culture after a federal investigation into their handling of sexual assault cases in 2013, the AAU survey still highlights a concerning trend. UNC participated in a similar survey conducted by the organization in 2015, which found <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/sexual-assault-data-released-by-unc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in four</a> female students had some form of an unwanted sexual experience.</p>
<p>In the report on the survey’s results, the university cautioned against comparing the 2015 results too directly with the 2019 survey. Students’ responses may have been affected by the improvement of national awareness about sexual assault and its prevalence, meaning more students were willing to share their experiences. Changes to the survey, including updates to definitions of experiences and sequence of questions, also affect direct comparisons.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2019/10/15/message-from-university-leaders-on-association-of-american-universities-campus-climate-survey-on-sexual-assault-and-misconduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a letter</a> to the campus community about the survey’s results, UNC Interim Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz urged every person to seek ways to change this culture.</p>
<p>“The data are very concerning,” said Guskiewicz, “and reinforce what we know to be true both on our campus and across the country: sexual assault and sexual harassment are serious problems that deeply affect our community. These behaviors have profound physical and emotional effects on the people who experience them and also have lasting impacts on other members of the campus community.”</p>
<p>Guskiewicz said the university will once again look to strengthen its efforts against sexual assault, including the formation of a coalition in the next month with the purpose of creating a strategy to improve prevention and awareness.</p>
<p>“This survey is a reminder of the importance of those actions,” he said, “but also that our work is not done.”</p>

<p>In the Chapel Hill mayoral race, the paper endorsed mayoral candidate and incumbent Pam Hemminger, citing her work securing the affordable housing bond in 2018 and her prioritization of combating climate change as main reasons it is supporting her.</p>
<p>For the Chapel Hill town council race, INDY Week endorsed candidates Jessica Anderson, Sue Hunter, Tai Huynh, and Michael Parker. It said its support for Anderson and Parker, two incumbents in the race, stems from Parker&#8217;s stances on housing and transit and Anderson&#8217;s background as a policy analyst. Hunter earned INDY Week&#8217;s endorsement thanks to her stance on climate change and her endorsements from progressive groups, while Huynh&#8217;s perspective as an entrepreneur and UNC student interests the paper.</p>
<p>The candidates in Carrboro&#8217;s Board of Aldermen race who received INDY Week endorsements are Susan Romaine, Damon Seils and Sammy Slade. The paper said they support incumbents Seils and Slade based off their track-records on the board, while endorsing Romaine thanks to her work with the hunger relief organization <span>PORCH and the Orange County Living Wage Project.</span></p>
<p>While Carrboro mayor Lydia Lavelle is running unopposed, the newspaper voiced its support for her and her policies.</p>
<p>In Hillsborough&#8217;s Board of Commissioners race, INDY Week endorsed the three incumbent candidates running: Mark Bell, Matt Hughes and Evelyn Lloyd. While she is running unopposed, the newspaper also endorsed commissioner Jenn Weaver to be Hillsborough&#8217;s mayor and voiced its support of her housing and sustainability policies.</p>

<p>Now, after delays from Hurricanes Florence and Dorian and <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/chapel-hill-exploring-options-for-coal-ash-remediation-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coal ash remediation projec</a>t along the creek bank, construction to complete the stretch of the trail has finally resumed. The crews are extending the concrete path under the bridge eastward toward Bolinwood Drive, connecting to the existing paved trail.</p>
<p>The topic of coal ash deposits and their removal have long loomed over development and renovation to the Bolin Creek Trail. 828 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, where the town’s police department is currently located, was a coal ash disposal site and borders the trail.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill has taken steps to prevent any further contamination of the soil since. Preventing any runoff of contaminated soil into Bolin Creek was a topic of discussion for the town council <a href="http://chapelhill.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=7&amp;clip_id=3743&amp;meta_id=213146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June</a>, as they heard plans for the removal of soil.</p>

<p>David Duncklee, President and Senior Hydrogeologist of Duncklee &amp; Dunham which handled the coal ash removal, told the council while they will continue to monitor the soil on the property, there was no sign of runoff at the time into Bolin Creek.</p>
<p>“After these recent floods and heavy rains, we didn’t see a lot of washout,” Duncklee said. “But if there’s something observed once all the soil is removed and we’ve backfilled with clean [soil] or something that happens that potentially looks like it washed out coal ash, we could certainly take additional samples.”</p>
<p>While the future of the police department property is unknown, John Richardson, the Community Resilience Officer for Chapel Hill, said fences would be installed to prevent silt and runoff from the removal of coal ash from draining into Bolin Creek.</p>
<p>“Once we get the interim measures in place and once a decision has been made about where the police station can go,” Richardson said about the property, “we’d like to continue the conversation we started with you and the community about the future use of this property and how that relates to difference remediation options for the site.”</p>
<p>Additional renovations to the existing trail will follow once the extension is complete. Crews will replace the asphalt trail between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Bolinwood Drive with concrete to better withstand future flooding. The existing trail will also be moved further from Bolin Creek in at least one location and wood decking on the foot bridge from the street will also be replaced.</p>
<p>The town estimates the project will take around four months to complete and construction will be weather-dependent.</p>

<p>Here is a list of questions that candidates were asked along with timestamps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Candidate introductions (2:00)</li>
<li>Let’s start with downtown Chapel Hill: what should the Town Council be doing to make downtown a better place? (11:00)</li>
<li>Is Chapel Hill growing at the right pace? What should Town Council be doing to ensure that Chapel Hill does grow at the right pace? (20:00)</li>
<li>Chapel Hill has been trying for years to increase the commercial tax base, but property owners still pay a disproportionate share of the taxes. What more should Chapel Hill be doing to ease that tax burden on property owners? (29:00)</li>
<li>What, if anything, is town government currently devoting too many resources to? (38:00)</li>
<li>What’s the most important thing Chapel Hill can do to make itself a more welcoming and inclusive community? (42:00)</li>
<li>Chapel Hill is a town committed to a particular set of values: inclusiveness, democracy, economic and environmental sustainability, racial justice, and transparency, to name a few. Tell us what <em>you</em> have done, in the past, to promote those values in your community. (47:00)</li>
<li>Let’s talk transportation. Chapel Hill Transit is very highly regarded, but traffic is still getting heavier on Chapel Hill roads. What should the town be doing to make it easier, safer, more convenient, and more efficient for people to get from place to place? (56:00)</li>
<li>Let’s talk housing. Affordable housing is always hard to come by, and there’s also a need for additional housing for students, seniors, and families, not to mention those who work in Chapel Hill. When it comes to housing, what is the most important thing you think the Town Council ought to do in the next two years? (1:10:00)</li>
<li>As an elected official, what will you do to fight climate change? And what will you do to address the impact of climate change locally? (1:24:00)</li>
<li>When people are deciding where to live or where to locate a business, they look to a community’s comparative advantage. I live in Durham because you can get more house for the money there. That’s Durham’s comparative advantage. So &#8211; what is Chapel Hill’s comparative advantage? Or what <i>should </i>it be? And what should Town government be doing to foster it? (1:33:00)</li>
<li>Just for the Town Council candidates: With seven candidates on the ballot, it’s not always easy to identify what makes each candidate stand out. Tell us what <i>you </i>bring to the table that no one else does. What will the Town Council be lacking if you are not elected? (1:40:00)</li>
<li>Finally, what <i>haven&#8217;t </i>we discussed today that ought to be a priority for the town of Chapel Hill? (1:47:00)</li>
</ul>

<p>A federal court granting the move could scuttle the plaintiffs&#8217; case, since the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/state-news/nc-redistricting-fight-turns-to-state-courts-after-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently declared</a> federal courts lack authority to rule on partisan gerrymandering claims.</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers have run several stand-alone bills containing popular topics from the vetoed budget.

He revealed the role of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Integrity and Risk Management and his selection of George Battle III for the job.</p>
<p>In a release, Guskiewicz described the role as being comprised of several important aspects for the university that were previously shared among multiple administrative areas. Battle will handle risk management, public safety, environmental safety, emergency management, policy management and ethics education. He will also take the lead in addressing threats to the university from outside entities, like improper influence by foreign governments.</p>
<p>“This position is critical to meeting important University needs and follows a year-long strategic analysis of risk management and campus safety functions,&#8221; Guskiewicz said. &#8220;My decision to appoint George to this role came with the support of my senior leadership team. I am confident that he has the right mix of skills and expertise to quickly succeed in making a positive impact at our University.”</p>
<p>Battle, a former attorney and UNC alumnus, returns to UNC after serving as the general counsel for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education for nine years. Prior to that, he provided legal counsel to Carolinas Heathcare System.</p>
<p>In a statement, Battle said he is thrilled to be returning to Carolina in a professional capacity.</p>
<p>“My experience as a student at UNC-Chapel Hill put me on a path to pursue law and public service,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I look forward to serving the institution that has served me so well. I am eager to shape this new role, to connect much of the great work that is already being done across campus, and support the University’s mission of teaching, research and service.”</p>
<p>The creation of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Integrity and Risk Management title follows a tumultuous few years of on-campus incidents at UNC. Before and after the removal of the confederate statue <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/silent-sam-timeline-confederate-monument-unc-chapel-hill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Sam</a>, UNC Police have made numerous arrests on charges of inciting riots, destruction of property and assault. In the last month, <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/unc-chancellor-addresses-recent-disturbing-incidents-involving-campus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two disturbing cases</a> that occurred either on or close to campus unsettled students and led the university to increase patrols and its cooperation with Chapel Hill Police Department.</p>

The vacancy, which will be left by current commissioner Jenn Weaver running unattested for mayor, must be filled by appointment by the remaining commissioners rather than an election, due to state law. Current Hillsborough mayor Tom Stevens says the board wants to get an early start in filling the seat.</p>
<p class="p1">“We wanted to get ahead of that and start thinking about how we’re going to appoint a person to take her seat,” the Mayor says. “We’ve asked about whether we could do an election or if we’d need to do an appointment, apparently the state law is such that we’d need to do an appointment.”</p>
<p class="p1">Several commissioners express concern since this will now be the second seat filled by appointment after Matt Hughes was named a commissioner by the board last year. Stevens says the board would prefer to hold a special election, but their hands are tied.</p>
<p class="p1">“If we had our druthers we could probably say ‘let’s wait and have an election that could coincide with the primaries that happen in May’ so we wouldn’t have to wait too long to fill that seat,” says Stevens. “Turns out, we don’t have the authority to do so.”</p>
<p class="p1">While the board is looking to be thorough in their search, Stevens says they would like to find a candidate in time for the biannual school government held by the North Carolina League of Municipalities.</p>
<p class="p1">“We don’t want to over rush the process, but if we could go ahead and identify somebody in short order to do that, we could also get them in on the training that the school government does for new officials,” Stevens states. “It happens only once every two years, so that person would have at least some more background and have the opportunity to have that education.”</p>
<p class="p1">The board will be proposing a schedule at the meeting on Monday, and hopes to begin looking at candidates and holding interviews in November.</p>

<p>Orange County cider makers Botanist &amp; Barrel has released its first canned hard ciders.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s flagship Farmhouse &#8220;seriously dry&#8221; cider will be available in cans for the first time across the south. Cans will be found in stores, restaurants and bars, according to a press release.</p>
<p><span>&#8220;We really want to show the raw terrior of the south with Appalachia and Piedmont apples,&#8221; says Botanist &amp; Barrel founding partner Amie Fields.</span></p>
<p>The Farmhouse is unpasteurized and unfiltered, one of the qualities the cidery boasts for all its cider products. It&#8217;s also additive and sugar free.</p>
<p>The initial launch of the Botanist &amp; Barrel cans was set for two locations on October 11 with<span> Durham&#8217;s Beer Study hosting a can release with Appalachian Vintner of Asheville releasing the cans in their bottle shop and bar. A</span><span> portion of Botanist&#8217;s sales at Beer Study Friday went to the charity Baggingit4kids, an organization in Durham that helps feed food insecure children in the area.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We have been longtime fans of Botanist and Barrel at Beer Study and we have been eagerly awaiting their first can release,&#8221; said Kerri Hoffman, GM of Beer Study Durham. &#8220;Farmhouse &#8216;seriously dry&#8217; cider won&#8217;t last long here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Founded in 2017 by the sibling duo of Lyndon and Kether Smith, Botanist &amp; Barrel creates a variety of craft ciders, sours and dry fruit wines. Their <a href="https://chapelboro.com/wchl/tu-for-two/tu-for-two-botanist-barrel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tasting room</a> is located in Cedar Grove.</span></p>

<p>What’s the explanation?</p>
<p>Demographic statistics suggest it&#8217;s all about increased commutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fewer people who work in Orange County are living in Chapel Hill, Carrboro or Hillsborough, compared to a decade ago,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.ncdemography.org/staff/rebecca-tippett-ph-d/">Rebecca Tippett</a>, the director of <a href="https://www.ncdemography.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolina Demography at UNC’s Carolina Population Center</a>.</p>
<p>Tippett says Orange County’s population is up about nine percent this decade, but that’s the slowest population growth we’ve seen since the 1930s.</p>
<p>In Chapel Hill specifically, the slowdown has been even more dramatic: after growing by at least 19 percent in each of the last four decades, Chapel Hill’s population in the 2010s has grown by just 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>Carrboro’s growth has slowed down as well – only nine percent this decade, versus at least 38 percent in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s (and 16.7 percent in the 2000s).</p>
<p>&#8220;(It&#8217;s been) very different from the last few decades,&#8221; Tippett says.</p>
<p>So why are we perceiving so much more traffic on our roads?</p>
<p>Tippett says the answer lies in our commute times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2002, there&#8217;s been a steady uptick in the number of Orange County residents who leave the county for work,&#8221; she says. &#8220;At the same time, there&#8217;s been an even faster growth in the number of people who are working in Orange County but aren&#8217;t living here. They&#8217;re coming here from somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau, since 2007 there’s been a 15 percent drop in the number of Orange County residents who work in Chapel Hill, and a significant increase in the number of residents who leave the county for work. At the same time, people who work in Orange County are now more likely to live outside of Orange and commute in for their jobs.</p>
<p>According to those census numbers, there are more than 41,000 people who commute into Chapel Hill to work – versus only 14,000 who leave Chapel Hill for their jobs.</p>
<p>And Tippett says that’s what’s making Chapel Hill feel crowded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chapel Hill&#8217;s daytime population increases by over 25,000 people, due to in-commuting from other places,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So if it feels like there&#8217;s more people here&#8230;it&#8217;s probably because of the employment factor, not because of the permanent population.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of Chapel Hill residents who work in Chapel Hill?</p>
<p>As of 2017, only 6,627.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tippett presented those numbers in September at the <a href="https://www.carolinachamber.org/">Chamber for a Greater Chapel Hill-Carrboro</a>&#8216;s annual State of the Community Report.</strong></em></p>

The Chapel Hill Town Council shared their impressions of the initial designs last week.</p>
<p>The council’s review of the concept plans came just eight days after Ram Realty, the ownership group of the mall, heard feedback from the town’s <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/development/chapel-hill-commission-underwhelmed-by-university-place-concept-plans-heading-to-town-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Design Commission</a>. Council members expressed encouragement over the redesign of the mall, which features more outdoor areas and pedestrian access than the current enclosed mall according to <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/concept-plan-calls-for-major-development-at-university-place-in-chapel-hill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concept plans</a>.</p>
<p>University Place’s location on a flood plain, however, presents challenges to renovations or development along South Estes Drive, as the area has been subject to severe flooding. Like the Community Design Commission, town council members expressed concern over the ownership group’s lack of strategy for addressing those past issues.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill mayor Pam Hemminger urged Ram Realty to consider installing measures to improve the space’s stormwater drainage.</p>
<p>“I think it’d be really helpful if you’d be willing to incorporate some stormwater features,” said Hemminger. “I don’t know if you can put a stormwater pond, but there are green stormwater features now we know of that can be added to help [with flooding.]”</p>
<p>Council member Michael Parker said he liked the redesign and its vision, but wanted to see more preparation for traffic from Fordham Boulevard. He pointed to the possibility of a transit corridor being developed alongside the mall during the renovation’s timeline, which remains a possibility despite the end of the Durham-Orange <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/orange-county-formally-votes-to-end-to-light-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light rail project</a>.</p>
<p>“I think you should start thinking about how you would integrate a high-capacity transit corridor on Fordham into your project,” Parker said. “Maybe you need to be thinking a little bit about making a more robust entryway so you at least allow for the possibility, if not a certainty, of a BRT off of Fordham.”</p>
<p>Council members also made comments about the lack of changes to the large parking lots on either side of the mall. Director of Investments of Ram Realty Ashley Saulpaugh said differences between tenants on long-term leases makes it so some parking lots cannot be altered.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of constraints and a lot of things we can’t touch,” said Saulpaugh. “While we’d love to [do so] and it’s not an appealing condition to have this large parking lot as this main feature, we’re going to do what we can to soften it. But, legally, we can’t touch it.”</p>
<p><span>WCHL moved its studios to University Place in October 2016. Ram Realty purchased the mall in 2018.</span></p>

As the players adjust to new leadership, head coach Courtney Banghart is settling into <a href="https://chapelboro.com/sports/unc-sports/unc-announces-hire-of-new-womens-basketball-coach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her new position</a> and school too.</p>
<p><u></u>Banghart led the team’s first official practice with lots of energy and passionate instruction last month. After 12 years as the coach of Princeton, she is still learning exactly how she wants to utilize the talent she has on the Tar Heels’ roster. Between coordinating with a new staff, learning about the school and recruiting in a new region, her adjustment to working at UNC continues every day.</p>
<p>But when she’s working with the players, she said she already feels right at home.</p>
<p>“College basketball is 94 feet, you play with a leather ball, and these [players] are wearing light blue,” Banghart said to the media following the practice. “That part of it is my comfort zone. It’s good to be in a place like this where I’ve been on the court basically since the day I got here.”</p>
<p>Banghart steps into the position at a time of major change around the women’s basketball program. She was hired in April <a href="https://chapelboro.com/sports/unc-sports/sylvia-hatchell-resigns-as-unc-womens-basketball-coach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the resignation</a> of Hall of Fame head coach Sylvia Hatchell. Hatchell had coached the Heels since 1986 and led them to a national championship in 1994. But after student-athlete complaints sparked a review of the program by the university, it was found Hatchell made racially insensitive remarks and may have created a culture that pressured players to return from injuries sooner than advised. She resigned as head coach shortly after and several players <a href="https://chapelboro.com/sports/unc-sports/four-unc-womens-basketball-players-reported-to-be-transferring-amid-program-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the transfer portal</a>.</p>
<p>Banghart acknowledged the stress such controversies leave on a program, saying she and the current players have used those experiences to grow together and transition to her coaching methods.</p>
<p>“No one signs on for the void that is losing a coach,” Banghart said. “I had void too, because I left a team. We kind of met in the middle of that void. They’ve [had their] eyes and ears open to how this program is going to be under my leadership. It’s been a process.”</p>
<p>On a campus with many other Hall of Fame coaches, it could be easy to become intimidated or feel overshadowed. Banghart said, though, she’s felt nothing but welcomed by UNC’s other athletic programs. She said many of the other coaches have helped her navigate her transition to campus by answering her questions and helping with recruiting. Banghart even joked that Sally Brown, the wife of football head coach Mack Brown, should watch out because she talks with Mack nearly every day.</p>
<p>“This is a community,” said Banghart. “Just like it is for the student athletes, I’ve found that it is for the coaches as well. I feel like the new guy, but I feel like people are wrapped around me, at times pushing me and carrying me to the excellence they currently have. It’s been an honor.”</p>

<p>An email sent this week by the off-campus apartment complex to residents says the contractor was hired to eliminate the mold, but the issue might not be resolved for weeks.</p>
<p>Granville Towers&#8217; management discovered the mold after residents who were experiencing health problems and visiting doctors notified them. The housing complex now has cleaning crews going room by room to complete deep cleans while its residents are paid to stay in nearby hotels for two days at staggered intervals.</p>
<p>Granville Towers management have also allowed upperclassmen residents to be released from their lease if they would prefer to move. First-year residents in Granville are also being allowed to transfer to on-campus residence halls without additional fees.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Granville residents have had to stay in hotels. In 2017, 200 students were displaced after broken sprinkler head caused flooding and leaks in some of the rooms. There was flooding in 2012 as well, when a PVC pipe for the sprinkler system got melted by an overheated ventilation fan and caused 140 students from three floors of the East tower to relocate for two weeks.</p>
<p>Granville Towers has been available as off-campus student housing at UNC for more than 50 years. The complex underwent renovation in 2010, but it was largely repainting, re-carpeting, and updating the fitness center.</p>

But a report published in The Athletic this week claimed that for years UNC student-athletes, particularly football players, were testing positive for ADHD at abnormally high rates – which the report claims could have tainted some concussion research for failing to disclose that information in research journals.</p>
<p>The Athletic <a href="https://theathletic.com/1261858/2019/10/08/failure-to-disclose-the-mysterious-absence-of-critical-data-from-uncs-renowned-concussion-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the article</a> on Tuesday after what the sports-journalism website said was a months-long investigation. But Guskiewicz responded on Thursday in a statement <a href="https://tbicenter.unc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to the website</a> for the Matthew Gfeller Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center at UNC.</p>
<p>“I stand by our concussion research 100 percent. The allegations about our research are baseless, without scientific merit and completely false,” Guskiewicz said in the statement. He said research protocols at UNC go through “a robust internal review process, and in most cases an additional external grant review process.”</p>
<p>The statement goes on to say that every medical journal “has its own disclosure policies; we have always fully complied with those guidelines.”</p>
<p>Under a section labeled “Key Points,” the website post also targets a main source of The Athletics article – Ted Tatos – a researcher at the University of Utah. The post said “no recognized scientific journal has published” a study from Tatos and another researcher that The Athletic draws on in its post.</p>
<p>The Athletic also has drawn some criticism for not disclosing that Tatos <a href="https://chapelboro.com/wchl/features/sports-notebook-wchl/chasnskys-notebook-bluedevilicious" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operated a Twitter account</a> under the name Bluedevilicious that often targeted UNC in the wake of the academic scandal.</p>
<p>The center is still conducting traumatic brain injury research and was recently awarded &#8211; along with <span>Harvard Medical School, Boston Children’s Hospital, and the Medical College of Wisconsin &#8211; a grant from the NFL to further research CTE, or Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, which has been a growing concern among retired football players.</span></p>

";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Brighton McConnell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4222:"<p>The Orange County School Board finalized the hire of Dr. Monique Felder as the district&#8217;s new superintendent on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Felder comes to Orange County after three years as a chief academic officer for Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools in Tennessee. Previously, she worked in numerous administration roles in Maryland’s two largest school districts.</p>
<p>Many members of the community visited Cedar Ridge High School Wednesday night to meet and speak with Felder following her official hiring by the Orange County School Board. The new superintendent said the crowd already encouraged and energized her.</p>
<p>“I’m just thrilled beyond measure to have the opportunity to take on this important role,” said Felder, “and to work with the community to galvanize all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Orange County Schools began the search for a new superintendent shortly after Dr. Todd Wirt<a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/pre-k-12-education/orange-county-schools-superintendent-resigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> stepped down from the position</a> in June. Chair of the school board Will Atherton said when searching for candidates, Felder stood out because of her variety of qualifications from her 28 years in public education.</p>
<p>“When we interviewed Dr. Felder,” Atherton said, “her credentials spoke for themselves. There were lots of great results, she was able to articulate how she would do things differently here, and she did a lot of research on Orange County. It was very impressive of her background and experience to take it from a very large school system and come to our personal community school system.”</p>
<p>Atherton said Felder’s extensive research showed that she truly wanted to work for the school system and community, which further encouraged the school board.</p>
<p>“She knew our population; she understood all of our schools; she came before her interview and actually visited our schools to take a look at them. She looked at our data on how our schools were performing, our pre-K and really how we’re doing as a whole.”</p>
<p>Felder said one reason the Orange County Schools system appealed to her is <a href="http://www.orangecountyfirst.com/content/board-education-moves-pass-district-equity-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its equity policy</a>. She said at this stage in her career, student equity is a key issue to her and that the board’s unity in its efforts moved her.</p>
<p>“To see that this is the direction this district is going in,” said Felder, “and they’ve put effort into it, I said, ‘I want to align with you; I want to work with you; I want to lock arms with you.’ Because I know this village work and the focus on equity is the ticket to make great things happen for all kids.”</p>
<p>Felder said she is most proud of the improved graduation rates seen in Metro Nashville Public Schools during her three years there, especially among minority communities. She also pointed to a new comprehensive literacy plan, improved ACT scores and increased industry certifications among students as other achievements in her previous district. Felder credited these results to a collective focus on the students’ needs and said she plans to aim for similar results in Orange County.</p>
<p>“That’s the key in every district I’ve been in: stay focused on children,” said Felder. “We’ve got to leave our egos and other agendas at the door and keep focused on children and what they need. They’re counting on us, and we have to be their champions.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to her contract with Orange County Schools, Felder will have a base annual salary of $126,612 set by the state&#8217;s scale for superintendents, with additional supplements of $45,533 a year from Orange County and $253 per month in recognition of her doctoral degree.</p>
<p>Felder will officially take office effective November 1.</p>

<p>The festival, which is held by the Alliance for Historic Hillsborough and the Ayr Mount Historic Site, will celebrate the Scottish history and heritage of the town as well as the popular book and television series &#8216;Outlander.&#8217;</p>
<p>The Ayr Mount property will be the site of the family-friendly festivities over the two days. Saturday will be the <i><span>Cèilidh Ayr</span></i>, which will feature traditional Scottish storytelling, music and dances. Sunday&#8217;s <i>Outlandish Ayr</i> will celebrate the series&#8217; connections to North Carolina and Hillsborough, featuring reenactments, readings, and a photo booth. On both days, Scottish food and local Hillsborough businesses will be on-site.</p>
<p>Hillsborough mayor Tom Stevens explained the history of the Ayr Mount mansion during a conversation with WCHL. The Kirkland family, who <a href="https://classicalamericanhomes.org/about-the-kirkland-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">owned the house</a> for decades, immigrated to the state in the late 1780s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ayr Mount was built about the same time Thomas Jefferson was building Monticello during the early-frontier, post-colonial days,&#8221; said Stevens. &#8220;That property stayed with the Kirkland family up until the late 20th century when it was bought by [a third party] who has ultimately made the property open to the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite originally being set in Scotland, both the &#8216;Outlander&#8217; book and television series follow its main characters to a fictional community set in North Carolina. This fits with <a href="https://www.outlandishhillsborough.com/hillsborough-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state&#8217;s history</a> of Scottish immigration, with around 50,000 Highland Scots settling in North Carolina during the mid-18th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The series] talks about colonial-era days when the regulators were here, which is exactly what was happening in Hillsborough,&#8221; Stevens said. &#8220;So it&#8217;ll be looking at what life was like when the story of &#8216;Outlander&#8217; is taking place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The festival will <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/orange-county-public-library/outlandish-hillsborough-screening-of-braveheart/413170392663280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold a screening of &#8216;Braveheart&#8217;</a> at the Main Library in Hillsborough on Friday, October 11. The film will begin at 6:30 and the event is free to the public, though intended for adults.</p>
<p>To attend Outlandish Hillsborough, tickets must be bought <a href="https://www.outlandishhillsborough.com/tickets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from their website</a> before the festival begins. The organizers encourage visitors to park on-site, but after parking is full, complimentary shuttles will be available to take people from downtown to Ayr Mount. Both days of the fesitval will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>

<p>More than 400 volunteers provided more than 1,100 hours of service at more than 34 sites across five counties on Saturday, delivering food with Meals on Wheels, constructing homes with Habitat for Humanity, clearing debris from trails and restocking supplies in food pantries. They did all of this work on what’s known in the UNC Adams School of Dentistry as DEAH DAY, which stands for Directing Efforts And Honoring Deah and Yusor.</p>
<p>The annual day of service began after Deah Barakat, his wife Yusor Abu-Salha and her sister Razan Abu-Salha were murdered in Chapel Hill in February 2015. Barakat was a student in the school of dentistry, and Yusor was set to join him. Razan was an undergraduate student at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>Dean of school of dentistry at Carolina Scott De Rossi said in a release that DEAH DAY “is incredibly special to our school community.”</p>
<p>Deah was known across the school and the Triangle for his volunteer work, especially focusing on feeding those in need and providing dental service to underserved communities, locally and abroad. He and Yusor were planning to travel to Turkey to assist Syrian refugees there, but they were never able to take that trip.</p>
<p>The three Muslim college students were shot and killed just weeks after Deah and Yusor were married. Razan was visiting the newlyweds for dinner at their apartment in Finley Forest Condos in Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>Craig Hicks also lived at the complex and was viewed by other residents as someone with a quick temper and a love of firearms, according to the investigation following the murders.</p>
<p>Hicks entered a guilty plea to the three murders earlier this year. Families of the victims have continued to call the act a hate crime, but federal prosecutors did not ultimately bring those charges. Hicks was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences for the killings.</p>
<p>The inaugural DEAH DAY was held by students in the school of dentistry in September 2015 and has continued annually. Barakat’s brother also continues to carry on many volunteer projects in Deah’s name.</p>

<p>The gathering of people outside of Abernethy Hall was reflective of the community effort to create a center for UNC’s Latinx population. Current students, faculty and university officials spoke and performed a ribbon cutting. While the center has been open <a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2019/07/26/carolina-latinx-center-opens-with-expanded-programs-resources-for-campus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since July</a>, the ceremony was held so former students and retired officials could attend and see the results of their efforts of the last 10 years since the Carolina Latinx Collaborative was born.</p>
<p>Josmell Pérez, the director of the new center, reflected on the first time a student came into his office and said the Latinx community needed their own space on UNC’s campus. When he first began advocating for a center, he and his wife had just met. Friday, with his daughters in attendance, Pérez said it was incredible to see the journey come full circle.</p>
<p>“As an immigrant myself from Peru, I have firsthand experiences of the challenges and obstacles Latinx people face daily,” said Pérez. “I am thrilled there is a space on our campus that we all love here to create a sense of community among all faculty, staff and students. This space will help educate and celebrate the many aspects and contributions of the Latinx community at UNC and beyond.”</p>

<p>The CLC was unanimously approved by the school’s Board of Trustees <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2019/02/latinx-center-bot-0204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in January</a>. In the new space, the Latinx community will have a better way to connect with each other and engage UNC students looking to learn about the culture to improve inclusiveness on campus.</p>
<p>Associate journalism professor Paul Cuadros was a key advocate for the center’s development. He pointed out the importance of a space like this because of the growing Latinx population at UNC and across the country.</p>
<p>“We are a young community,” said Cuadros. “The median age of Latinx people here in North Carolina and the United States is 26 years old. We’re a population that’s growing, and the student population is the fastest growing in the state. We want those kids when they come to Carolina to be welcomed and we want their professors to be welcomed as well.”</p>
<p>UNC sophomore and Latinx Center ambassador Jacqueline Santillan shared her story and thanked those at the ceremony for their involvement advocating for the center. Although she’s not been at Carolina for very long, she said she still feels like part of the center’s development as it now becomes available for the UNC community. Santillan said a conversation with her sister, an alumna, helped her realize how lucky she is.</p>
<p>“[My sister] graduated in 2014,” she said. “It’s crazy because now she says, ‘I can’t believe there’s a Latinx Center at you’re working at it. When I was there, our community and population didn’t really have anywhere to go.’ She thought it was really interesting that I was able to speak today [at its ceremony].”</p>
<p>Santillan said the center is already seeing lots of action with students and that its importance will only continue to grow.</p>
<p>“This is open all day, and I see students all day studying, coming here with committees and making meetings. I never really saw that at the Carolina Latinx Collaborative. Now that we have a place to call ours, it’s really impactful.”</p>
<p>The Carolina Latinx Center will be holding more events at UNC to celebrate Latin Heritage Month, which ends October 15.</p>

<p>This year, the 5K will be Saturday October 12 at the Southern Community Park in Southern Village. The course consists of running north on the greenway to the intersection of Culbreth Road and US 15-501 before running back to the park.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue says he believes the course is a good selection because runners won’t have to worry about traffic or difficult directions.</p>
<p>“The cool thing about this run is that it’s a very unique course,” he says. “There’s hardly any conflict with any roadways because you’re on the greenway, so you can really get out there and move. It’s a great and challenging course.”</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Police Captain Josh Mecimore helps organize the event each year and says he’s proud of the department’s history in partnering with Special Olympics.</p>
<p>“Over the little more than 25 years we’ve been supporting Special Olympics,” Mecimore says, “the Chapel Hill Police Department has raised over $1.5 million to support them. In many of those years, we’ve been the leading agency in the state; most we’ve been in the top ten.”</p>
<p>Mecimore says while the department holds other smaller events to raise money for Special Olympics, the 5K is their marquee fundraiser.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important,” he says, “because it allows the athletes who participate in Special Olympics to be able to participate throughout the state in the Special Olympic Games.”</p>
<p>Blue says while runners start their race at 9 a.m., there will be more activities after the race is finished. He also said people will have the chance to learn about Chapel Hill’s different emergency services.</p>
<p>“In addition to the run itself,” says Blue, “we’ll have some informational booths set up for the police department, fire department and Orange County Emergency Services, so people can get a chance to interact with some of the first responders who are serving our community. [They can] spend some time with them and have a little fellowship both before and after the run.”</p>
<p>Parking for the Guardians of the Hill 5K will be available at the Southern Community park-and-ride lot. Registration for the 5K is $25 per runner and runs through Friday, with signup available <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/Events/NC/ChapelHill/GuardiansoftheHill5K#event-312332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>The auditor’s office hotline received a tip in September 2018 the prompted the investigation.</p>
<p>The overpayment resulted from a “local parts vendor” who operated an on-site facility to work on the town’s vehicle fleet “altering work orders and submitting false invoices,” the report said. The vendor was not named either in the report or in an email from town manager Maurice Jones to the Town Council, but contracts provided by the town show the town was working with Raleigh-based Walker Automotive Supply.</p>
<p>The town was charged for parts that did not fit town fleet vehicles, parts that might fit but did not match the associated work order, deposit charges for parts that could be recycled, and duplicate invoices. Work orders were also altered to submit additional invoices for parts not involved in the work order, adding parts to the invoice that were not listed on the work order and creating duplicate invoices of the same work order.</p>
<p>The town entered a contract with the vendor in May 2012 and the employee who managed the store operated the location until they were promoted to a new role at the vendor in the spring of 2017. The employee is no longer employed by the vendor as of February 2018, according to the town manager’s email.</p>
<p>The auditor’s report said the issue arose because the town’s work order system did not interface with the parts vendor’s invoice system, the parts vendor did not provide adequate parts detail reporting and the town’s fleet manager did not sufficiently review the invoices.</p>
<p>In light of the auditor’s findings, the vendor has now reimbursed the town $134,112,10 for parts not used. An additional review is underway to assess invoices flagged as being for parts that might fit town vehicles but were not listed on work orders. That review could lead to the town requesting additional payment up to $76,000.</p>
<p>The town has developed new Fleet Parts Accounting Procedures that were implemented in January 2019, according to Jones’ email.</p>
<p>A review is ongoing to the time periods immediately before and after the audited window. If additional discrepancies are discovered the town will extend the review further.</p>
<p>The town did renew its contract with the same vendor in June 2019. Jones cited the vendor’s cooperation with the reimbursement process as part of the reason for renewing the contract, in addition to it being “the most effective and efficient method for the Town to purchase parts.”</p>
<p>“Other area municipalities have a similar agreement with this same parts vendor,” Jones wrote.</p>
<p>Staff will evaluate the contract in June 2020 and report to the manager’s office with a recommendation for moving forward.</p>
<p>The auditor’s report said the findings were referred to the district attorney’s office for review as to whether criminal charges should be pursued.</p>

<p>Patrick Conway was found guilty of driving while impaired and misdemeanor child abuse, news sources reported. Court records show Conway was charged after a June 22 crash on Interstate 85 in Randolph County in which his SUV collided with a tractor-trailer.</p>
<p>Conway&#8217;s attorney, Jonathan Megerian, argued that North Carolina child abuse laws aren&#8217;t intended to be applied in cases in which children aren&#8217;t injured and when the risk of injury is accidental. However, Judge Sarah Neely Lanier ruled Conway guilty on all charges.</p>
<p>Megerian said he will appeal the judge&#8217;s verdict.</p>
<p>Conway resigned his position on Sept. 25 amid pressure from North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey to step down. Causey said he&#8217;d learned of Conway&#8217;s arrest from a news report and accused Blue Cross of trying to conceal what happened.</p>
<p>A statement attributed to the company&#8217;s board said that it engaged outside lawyers and other experts to examine the crash immediately after it happened. The board said it asked for Conway&#8217;s resignation after more investigative material surfaced.</p>
<p>An investigative report of the accident obtained by WRAL-TV and written by the Archdale police investigating officer said Conway had bloodshot eyes and a strong odor of alcohol at the scene and became &#8220;absolutely belligerent&#8221; at the police department.</p>

<p>Pendergrass made the announcement on The Ron Stutts Show on 97.9 The Hill WCHL on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“It’s our community, simply put,” Pendergrass said Wednesday when announcing why he would be running.</p>
<p>“I’ve had the privilege of working in district court – focusing solely really on district court litigation – now in my eighth year and getting a lot of experience in all the courtrooms throughout Orange and Chatham counties.</p>
<p>“But combining that with also the community work I’ve been able to engage in and the different corners of the community I’ve been able to work in, people I’ve been able to meet – even since I grew up here – there’s so much more you can always learn, never stop learning in our community. The combination of those two things – experience in the courtroom, experience in the community – led me to today.”</p>
<p>Pendergrass is a native of Carrboro and has been working as an attorney with Epting and Hackney. He graduated from Chapel Hill High School before earning an undergraduate degree from UNC and going to law school at North Carolina Central University.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://hathawaypendergrass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website launched</a> in conjunction with the announcement said Pendergrass has built a judicial philosophy focused on three pillars: ensuring equity in the judicial process, connecting with compassion and advocating in the best interests of children and youth.</p>

<p>“People who come before district court judges, they at a minimum are having a bad day. Most of them are having one of the worst, if not the worst day of their life,&#8221; Pendergrass said Wednesday. &#8220;Connecting as much as I can with every single person that comes before me, I think, is of the highest degree of importance in this job.”</p>
<p>Pendergrass, who is 35 years old, said he feels his experience in the courtroom will alleviate concerns over his age.</p>
<p>“It’s a new job,” he said. “Whether you’ve been doing it for three or 30 years, it’s just a new job; it’s going to be a huge learning curve for anybody. But I think wisdom is really even more key than experience. The idea of knowing what you know and more importantly what you don’t know.”</p>
<p>Pendergrass has served on the board of the Orange County Rape Crisis Center, planning boards in Carrboro and Orange County and serves as a teen court judge with Volunteers for Youth diversionary program.</p>
<p>Pendergrass is running for the seat currently held by Judge Jay Bryan, who will be forced to retire due to age in January. Four district court judge seats will be up for election in Orange and Chatham counties in 2020. In addition to the seat held by Bryan, seats currently occupied by Samantha Cabe, Sherri Murrell and Beverly Scarlett will be up for election.</p>

The announcement came at a meeting of the community college’s Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Ingram has served in various roles at Durham Tech since 1983 and has been leading the college since January 2008.</p>
<p>Durham Tech has grown under Ingram’s leadership with new buildings and programs on the main campus and opening new campus locations, including expanding to an Orange County campus in Hillsborough early after Ingram took the role as president.</p>
<p>Ingram wrote in a letter to chair of the college’s Board of Trustees John Burness that he was “gratified” by what’s been accomplished during his tenure as president. Ingram also highlighted partnerships with UNC – Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University to funnel more community college graduates and transfers to those four-year institutions.</p>
<p>The college is also in the middle of the Forge Great Futures fundraising campaign, which launched in April with a goal of raising $5 million by June 2020.</p>
<p>Burness wrote back to Ingram that he read the retirement letter “with decidedly mixed emotions,” adding that while he knew of Ingram’s plans, “seeing your letter in black and white is a real reminder how far the College has come under your steady guiding hand as President of the College.”</p>
<p>A search committee is expected to be formed later this fall to lead the process to name the college’s fifth president, succeeding Ingram. Ingram’s last day is set for June 30, 2020, at the conclusion of his current contract. He did offer to remain in that role for two additional months “should the Board of Trustees believe such an extension to be useful.”</p>

<p>Attorney General Josh Stein announced in August that he was suing eight more vaping companies under the state&#8217;s unfair and deceptive trade laws. Stein accuses them of aggressively marketing their products to young people and failing to use proper age verification, and he wants their sales to end.</p>
<p>Stein said on Monday that VapeCo. Distribution has agreed not to sell or market vapor products in the state. His office says there are preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders stopping sales by Electronic Tobacconist, Electric Lotus, Direct eLiquid and Beard Vape while the lawsuits continue.</p>

<p>“I have no idea,” he said. “It’s dadgum complicated, and it’s going to be coming in 2023. Hell, I hope I’m alive in 2023; I hope I’m still teeing it up.”</p>
<p>Williams is right: it is a complicated matter. The bill, signed into law last week by California Governor Gavin Newsom, will allow college athletes in the state to <a href="https://chapelboro.com/wchl/features/sports-notebook-wchl/chanskys-notebook-no-big-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profit off their image, name and likeness</a> starting in 2023. The NCAA has prohibited this for years under the argument it would rescind college athletes’ amateur status, likely setting the stage for a legal showdown between the NCAA and California.</p>
<p>Williams said at his preseason media day last week that he has yet to read the law in full. While he said he’s always been against paying players outright for their efforts on the court, he gave an example that explained his feelings about players’ names and images being used by schools.</p>
<p>“When Peyton Manning was at Tennessee, the first football game they sold like 50,000 jerseys at $76 a jersey,” said Williams. “Peyton Manning didn’t get one cent, and that’s not right. So, I’ve always had that feeling, and it’s been the biggest feeling [on the matter.]”</p>
<p>While Williams said he hopes more moves will be made to protect and help college athletes, he also pointed to the improvement he’s seen in their rights just in the last few years. The creation of the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/autonomy-schools-adopt-cost-attendance-scholarships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘cost of attendance’</a> rule in 2015 that allows student-athletes to receive stipends for transportation, school supplies and similar costs is one example he mentioned.</p>
<p>“When Sean May was playing for me,” Williams said, “we had a prospect [on campus.] We took [May] out to eat with the prospect, but we had to take that money out of his meal money. When Sean was going to go home, he had to pay for it. We didn’t have the ‘cost of attendance’ thing that we have now that’s made it much more student-athlete friendly. So, I’m hopefully that we’ll keep making moves.”</p>
<p>Williams admitted, though, that he was focused continuing his team’s improvement and that when it comes to the United States, “it takes a while to change things.”</p>

<p>Authorities say no one was injured during the demonstration near the Chatham County Courthouse, where the monument has stood for more than a century.</p>
<p>Chatham&#8217;s commissioners voted 4-1 in August to ask a United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter to have a plan by Oct. 1 to remove the statute. The county let the UDC install the statute in 1907. Without a plan, the county will declare it a public trespass by Nov. 1, making it eligible for removal.</p>
<p>WTVD-TV reports the UDC didn&#8217;t submit a plan.</p>

<p>Kashuba was selected in May to take over as leader of the top pharmacy school in the nation. The permanent role had been vacant since Bob Blouin was hired as the university’s <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/unc-names-new-provost-executive-vice-chancellor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provost in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>At Tuesday’s ceremony, Kashuba described it as a privilege to begin her tenure as dean, promising to continue the innovation and research that led to the school becoming the country’s best.</p>
<p>“As the new dean of the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy,” Kashuba said, “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to build upon the school’s success and culture of excellence. While we are the number-one ranked school of pharmacy in the nation, I can assure you no one is willing to rest. We have significant momentum and we have the unique opportunity to go beyond excellence.”</p>
<p>In her career, Kashuba has authored more than 240 peer-reviewed publications and has been awarded over $20 million in research funding. She has taught at UNC since 1997, being named the John and Deborah McNeill, Jr. Distinguished Professor in 2013. Kashuba also serves as director of the UNC Center for AIDS Research Clinical Pharmacology and Analytical Chemistry Core.</p>
<p>Interim chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz shared his support of Kashuba at the ceremony, saying her leadership in classrooms and research labs should excite the UNC community with her taking over as dean.</p>
<p>“This school has a storied history that we’re so proud of,” said Guskiewicz. “Yet, we’re even more excited about its future. At this critical moment, Angela Kashuba is the right person to lead the Eshelman School of Pharmacy as we serve the state of North Carolina and beyond.”</p>
<p>Kashuba said she has many ways she wants to continue growing the pharmacy school, but she said one of her top focuses will be on improving rural health. She said because many North Carolinians cannot always come to UNC facilities or other healthcare services, it’s important for the school to use its tools and technology to go to them.</p>
<p>“Forty percent of North Carolinians live in rural counties and they <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/state-news/north-carolina-governor-pushes-for-medicaid-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not have</a> all the comprehensive health care services they need. I would like to make sure that we have pharmacists in the right roles to be at the forefront of care for all of our citizens.”</p>
<p>In the two years before Kashuba began her role as permanent dean, Dhiren Thakker served as the interim dean for the Eshelman School of Pharmacy.</p>

<p>In a written statement to The Associated Press, the Rev. Curtis Gatewood said he was “deeply sorry” for the way his actions were perceived. While denying any kind of sexual assault or intentional sexual harassment, Gatewood wrote in Tuesday’s statement that he didn’t “deny the feelings of my accusers.”</p>
<p>“While I know I had no sexual intentions toward my accusers, the thought that either woman felt even slightly uncomfortable in the workplace is unfortunate,” he said.</p>
<p>No criminal charges have been filed.</p>
<p>Two women have accused Gatewood of inappropriate behavior or sexual harassment. The accusations have spurred questions about whether a nationwide policy on sexual harassment is overdue for the NAACP. They also come amid the #MeToo movement, which aims to hold accountable those involved in sexual misconduct and those who cover it up.</p>
<p>Gatewood’s statement came after the second accuser, Courtney Sebring, published her essay on the Medium website on Friday. Sebring told the AP in a telephone interview Tuesday that she felt compelled to come forward after former state NAACP employee Jazmyne Childs held a<span> </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/5a16b53dc93d4fe3a5d68542826e7ed1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news conference</a><span> </span>on Sept. 24 questioning why the national NAACP did nothing after an outside investigation concluded that her accusations _ first made in 2017_ were credible.</p>
<p>“Jazmyne released her story, and I felt so heavy and burdened by this secret,” said Sebring, 23. “I know that doing anything to keep Gatewood’s secret makes me sick. And I feel stronger now that this is out.”</p>
<p>Sebring said she was a 17-year-old summer intern in 2014 when Gatewood’s stares and touches made her so uncomfortable that she told her parents and asked the NAACP for help. Gatewood was second vice president at the time, a position he held until 2011, when he became an NAACP staff member.</p>
<p>Gatewood, 60, left the NAACP in 2017. He said the reason was to allow him to run for president of the chapter, but his departure also happened during an outside investigation that then-state NAACP president the Rev. William Barber had ordered.</p>
<p>At her news conference, Childs, 27, chastised the national NAACP for not acting on the investigation. The national NAACP _ which doesn’t have a sexual harassment policy _<span> </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/cc685978d8a242ffb21e6efdf0075381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended Gatewood</a><span> </span>the next day. “Given that this matter concerns an internal disciplinary proceeding, the NAACP will have no further comment,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Sebring said she was an idealistic teenager when she worked at the NAACP’s state headquarters, then located in Durham. She said Gatewood’s harassment started within a week after she arrived, and ultimately, she asked her father, a 6-foot-6 (198-centimer) law enforcement officer, to drop in on Gatewood in uniform in the hopes of intimidating him. Gatewood backed off for about a week, she said.</p>
<p>Sebring’s mother, Serena Sebring, told the AP that the state NAACP’s interim executive director at the time, Rosalyn Pelles, told her another young woman had been sexually harassed previously. She said Pelles’ solution was to tell Gatewood to not be in the same room alone with her.</p>
<p>“I expected more than, ‘Just don’t be in the same room with him,’” Courtney Sebring said. “I expected an investigation. I expected accountability for a summer of harassment. And I just expected a deep apology.”</p>
<p>Pelles and Barber wrote in a text to the AP that after Sebring’s complaint was investigated and found to be credible, the NAACP “made every effort to comply with the remedy sought by the young woman.”</p>
<p>They also noted that the state organization established a sexual-harassment and sexual-assault policy and conducted staff training after Sebring made her allegations.</p>
<p>The current president of the state chapter, the Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, said Wednesday that the national office has postponed the state elections, scheduled for this weekend, as it investigates the accusations against Gatewood. In addition, he said national President Derrick Johnson will address the state convention Saturday in Greensboro.</p>
<p>Gatewood, meanwhile said he wants to be reinstated. “Since I am innocent, I have faith, through a fair process, my membership will be restored,” he wrote in an email.</p>

<p>UNC Police are investigating 12 incidents involving 14 victims claiming to have been sold fraudulent tickets to the sold-out contest, officials confirmed in an email.</p>
<p>One arrest has been made in connection to one of the transactions, but investigations into the other instances are ongoing. UNC Police arrested 52-year-old Codell Milton Daniels and charged him with one count of obtaining property by false pretense, according to an arrest report.</p>
<p>Police said no other incidents of counterfeit tickets being sold have been reported this season prior to the spike on Saturday.</p>
<p>The game against Clemson was the third-straight sellout in Kenan Stadium this season, representing all of the home football games to this point. The game against Duke on October 26 is also a sellout, according to the university.</p>
<p>This is the first instance in recent memory of Carolina football games being the target of fake ticket scammers.

<p>Robin Hayes, 74, pleaded guilty to making a false statement in August 2018 to FBI agents conducting the bribery investigation. Hayes, a former congressman, was initially also charged with conspiracy and bribery. His plea deal included the promise that he would help prosecutors build a case against co-defendants and potentially testify against them.</p>
<p>Prosecutors agreed that Hayes could avoid any time behind bars, but a judge could sentence him to no more than six months in prison. The government agreed to recommend a sentence “at the low end” of that range, along with monetary penalties, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>“Today was a big step forward. Robin looks forward to completing this process and moving ahead,” said Kearns Davis, Hayes’ lawyer. Hayes left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.</p>
<p>In an<span> </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/f434a9f72706408eb33015e3f6242936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indictment</a><span> </span>unsealed in April, prosecutors said Hayes agreed to use the state Republican Party as a conduit for filtering $250,000 to state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey’s reelection campaign. Prosecutors said Hayes agreed to funnel the money to Causey at the request of insurance magnate Greg Lindberg and an associate. Lindberg proposed moving $250,000 through the party’s coffers to Causey each quarter as part of his plan to provide the insurance regulator with $2 million in contributions for his expected 2020 reelection campaign, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Hayes initially protested, saying that moving so much money would draw attention, but eventually relented during the conversation, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you all want to do, we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; Hayes said, according to the indictment. &#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll get &#8216;er done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Causey, a Republican, reported the alleged bribe attempt to federal officials and for months helped them gather evidence, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Lindberg is an insurance and investment firm founder who has been among the state’s top political donors in recent years, giving more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016. He favored<span> </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/b80e0b10f56640e4a701d60e9760422a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican causes and politicians</a>, but also gave to Democrats.</p>
<p>Lindberg’s attorneys have asked that charges against him be dismissed, arguing in a in a<span> </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/e3cf2bab378f45f7b17c2f6786229dce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motion last month</a><span> </span>he was using his constitutional free-speech rights to support Causey. Lindberg “simply sought a fair and reasonable regulatory examination by a competent and neutral decision-maker” for his company, his lawyers said.</p>
<p>Lindberg and two associates charged with conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, bribery, and aiding and abetting are scheduled to go on trial as early as mid-November.</p>
<p>Hayes gave up operational duties as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party after the charges became public. He had announced just before the indictment was unsealed that he was not seeking reelection to the post.</p>
<p>Hayes, an heir to a textile fortune, represented North Carolina’s 8th District Congressional for a decade beginning in 1999. He was defeated by Democrat Larry Kissell in 2008.</p>

<p>When it purchased the mall in 2018, Ram Realty announced it would aim to <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/concept-plan-calls-for-major-development-at-university-place-in-chapel-hill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make updates</a> that would modernize the property and create a &#8220;town center&#8221; for Chapel Hill. Concept plans presented to the town’s Community Design Commission on September 24 show part of the existing central building being removed to create an outdoor green space and increased pedestrian access. It also shows creating more office, retail and hotel space from existing parking areas.</p>
<p>But feedback for the concept plans from the design commission was consistent across most of its members. Routinely describing the plans as &#8220;underwhelming,&#8221; many commissioners said they failed to see how the proposed renovations would significantly update the mall beyond its current existence.</p>
<p>Commissioner Susan Lyons said it seemed to her the three plans being considered by Ram Realty did not achieve the concepts used by other city centers and malls to change their layouts.</p>
<p>“I see lots of parking space,” she said at the meeting, “looking just like it does now. This concept is not new around the country. Even if it’s done in pieces, there was a plan initially that pulled it all together. I don’t see that here.”</p>
<p>University Place’s location in a flood plain creates certain levels of constraint to renovation. The mall’s parking lots have been flooded in the past, with the most severe recent incident<a href="https://chapelboro.com/photos/9-17-18-orange-county-flooding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> during Hurricane Florence</a>. Improving stormwater retention and renovating to prepare for floods was one of the top suggestions the design commission made to improve the concept plans.</p>
<p>The commission also emphasized creating affordable residential units if any housing space is built and improving pedestrian travel to the mall by connecting two nearby greenways, the Bolin Creek Trail and the Booker Creek Trail.</p>
<p>Chair of the commission Susana Dancy said to the Ram Realty representative that keeping those elements in mind would improve the town and the mall’s importance. She said the ownership group has the flexibility of more creativity for the land’s use, compared to the <a href="https://www.townofchapelhill.org/town-hall/departments-services/chapel-hill-2020/future-focus-areas/the-ephesus-fordham-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Hill District</a> where the land is all separately owned.</p>
<p>“You are in the situation where you own all of this,” said Dancy, “so you have the opportunity of better defining where the public place is going to be and what it’s going to feel like.”</p>
<p>Ram Realty will now take the concept plans for University Place to the Chapel Hill Town Council, which is expected to discuss and provide additional feedback at its meeting on Wednesday night at 7 p.m. in Town Hall.</p>

Roy Cooper tried on Tuesday to bring renewed energy toward resolving a summer budget stalemate that&#8217;s drifted into fall. But their hoped-for outcomes remain different.</p>
<p>Republican Senate leader Phil Berger announced his chamber will adjourn for the year by Oct. 31 with or without an enacted budget. He also kept open the idea of passing a spending plan by completing the override of Cooper&#8217;s budget bill veto or working out a side deal with Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point we&#8217;ve got to wrap this up,&#8221; Berger told reporters after legislators returned to Raleigh after a nearly two-week recess.</p>
<p>Cooper vetoed the GOP&#8217;s two-year state budget in late June largely because it lacks Medicaid expansion for hundreds of thousands of low-income adults and what he considers robust pay raises for teachers. Negotiations on a full, compromise budget idled as Democrats remained united to uphold any veto.</p>
<p>But the House Republicans voted three weeks ago to override in an unexpected vote during a floor session sparsely attended by Democrats later accusing Republican colleagues of trickery. That put the issue squarely in the Senate&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Cooper said earlier Tuesday he was confident that all 21 Senate Democrats would stick with him and support the veto. The shift of one Democratic senator or absence of two from the floor would open the door for Republicans to complete the override. Cooper has said expansion needs to be part of budget talks but rejects Republican accusations that expansion must be approved before he&#8217;ll negotiate.</p>
<p>All Republicans &#8220;want to do is try to find a way to override this budget whether it&#8217;s &#8230; by hook or crook or deception,&#8221; Cooper said after the monthly Council of State meeting. &#8220;I think people want us to negotiate, and I&#8217;m certainly willing to listen to an offer that&#8217;s less than what we have proposed. But yet we&#8217;ve heard nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>No Senate override vote has been scheduled, and Berger said Senate operating rules requiring 24 hours&#8217; notice will be followed. Berger said some Senate Democrats want to vote for an override but are afraid of &#8220;reprisals from the governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berger said he&#8217;d prefer to pass a replacement state budget that&#8217;s been agreed to by enough Democrats so there wouldn&#8217;t be another veto showdown with Cooper. Any agreement, Berger said, could include a pledge by himself and GOP House Speaker Tim Moore to hold a session early next year to discuss health care issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Senate Democrats realize they can achieve some of their budget priorities while also getting a special session on health care access,&#8221; Berger said.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue and House Minority Leader Darren Jackson tried on Tuesday to build on momentum for expansion. They led a public meeting in the Legislative Building attended by 30 Democratic legislators, taking testimony on the importance of offering Medicaid coverage through the 2010 federal health care law.</p>
<p>While Berger remains strongly opposed to expansion, Moore allowed a GOP-style Medicaid bill to resurface two weeks ago in committee, where it passed with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s hearing speakers included local residents whose family members or workers lack affordable insurance, as well as a professor who measured the benefits of expansion to the North Carolina economy and toward decreasing the number of uninsured.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results are truly positive,&#8221; George Washington University professor Leighton Ku said at the hearing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans planned this week to continue their recent tactic of passing stand-alone measures containing portions of the vetoed budget that have broad bipartisan support. Cooper said on Tuesday he&#8217;s unhappy with the &#8220;mini-budget&#8221; strategy and would prefer negotiations on the entire budget. Still, he&#8217;s signed all but one of those measures.</p>
<p>Moore appeared to telegraph support for Berger&#8217;s supplemental budget idea with Democrats to end the impasse. In an emailed statement, Moore pointed out on Tuesday improved revenue projections could help pay for more public education spending. Moore also said capital funding for K-12 schools, universities and community colleges &#8220;are of the utmost importance before adjourning for any significant period of time.&#8221;</p>

The $10 million gift from an anonymous donor will help the foundation keep providing scholarships to more UNC students for years to come.</p>
<p>The gift did not come with any conditions or requests to alter the scholarship program in any way, officials said. Morehead-Cain representatives say it reflects the donor’s confidence in the program’s impact on the UNC community and those who were scholarship recipients.</p>
<p>Chuck Lovelace, the executive director of the Morehead-Cain Foundation, says while the foundation had been in discussion with the donor for about a year, the emotions he felt when the gift became official are hard to explain.</p>
<p>“When it finally came through,” he says, “it’s just one of those moments where you’re overwhelmed by the generosity of the donor. How meaningful and impactful the gift is going to be for the program; it’s just hard to comprehend.”</p>
<p>The $10 million gift brings the foundation $10 million away from its fundraising goal during the university’s <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/unc-rolls-fundraising-announcements-campaign-kickoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campaign for Carolina</a>. The scholarship program is aiming to reach $75 million donated by the fundraiser’s completion. Lovelace says that amount will sustain scholarships to 75 UNC students per class, a new benchmark just reached by the foundation, for many years.</p>
<p>“That will bring 300 scholars on campus at any one time over the four classes,” says Lovelace. “That will be the largest we’ve ever been in the program’s history, which goes back to 1951.”</p>
<p>With their gift, the donor started the <a href="https://campaign.unc.edu/funding-priority/give-together-scholarship-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Give Together Scholarship Challenge</a>. Lovelace says its purpose to inspire other Morehead-Cain and UNC alumni to also donate to the foundation and help reach that fundraising goal.</p>
<p>“The donor was interested in not only helping us get to the end of our goal,”  he says, “but also encouraging alumni who might not have come to the table to join the campaign, get involved and expand people’s horizons on what they might be able to do for the program.”</p>
<p>The Give Together Scholarship Challenge will run through the end of the Campaign for Carolina on December 31, 2022.</p>

<p>The vacancies occurred when the previous chairman, Harry Smith, said on Sept. 24 that he was stepping down early and returning to the board as a member. His resignation was effective Tuesday.</p>

<p>One law adds new requirements upon ride-sharing drivers over time. Now they must display license tag numbers at the front of their vehicles so consumers can match them easier with what&#8217;s on their smartphones.</p>
<p>Another law makes it a felony to perform female genital mutilation on a child. The legislation responds to a judge&#8217;s ruling last year determining a federal law against the practice is unconstitutional but that states can regulate it.</p>
<p>Simplified licensing qualifications for dozens of state-regulated professions begin on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Authorities said Vernon Lamont Reed was arrested Monday and charged with first-degree forcible rape, robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and kidnapping.</p>
<p>Police had been investigating for more than two weeks after <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/crime/chapel-hill-police-asking-for-help-locating-sexual-assault-suspect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the assault took place</a> around 3 a.m. Friday, September 13, at Shortbread Lofts apartments.</p>
<p>“We would like to thank the community for the many tips that we’ve received in this very difficult case,” Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue said in a release. “And, our investigators have worked around the clock for more than two weeks to run those tips down. The tips, the immense amount of community interest in this case, and the hard work of our investigations team are what have led us to the arrest today.”</p>
<p>Reed is being held in the Orange County Jail under a $500,000 secured bond and is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This was one of <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/campus-safety-top-of-mind-at-unc-board-of-trustees-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple incidents in recent weeks</a> that have caused safety concerns, specifically among members of the UNC community.</p>
<p>Authorities said anyone who feels they are in need of assistance, either speaking with the Crisis Unit about how they were affected by the news of the assault, receiving information about personal safety resources or receiving a site security check, is asked to call (919) 968-2760 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. If you feel you are in immediate danger, call 911.</p>

<p>“Let’s be honest, we are the university of national champions,” Interim chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said Friday at a ceremony celebrating the opening of the new Media and Communications center on campus, constructed in conjunction with the launch of the ACC Network.</p>
<p>But most of those championships have been won in sports that don’t receive the same attention as football or men’s basketball.</p>
<p>“Carolina athletics is special,” athletics director Bubba Cunningham said. “We have 28 intercollegiate teams; we have over 800 student-athletes. And this building gives us the opportunity to really highlight all the successes of our teams, our students and our coaches.</p>
<p>“This ACC Network will allow us to televise those Olympic sports that heretofore haven’t seen enough national recognition. Our Olympic sport programs have won more than half of our 50 national championships as a university.”</p>
<p>More of those games will be brought to fans across the country now through the ACC Network – a new television channel launched by the conference in partnership with cable-sports giant ESPN. To make those broadcasts a reality, each school in the ACC constructed a new media center. UNC showed off its facility on Friday.</p>
<p>“The ACC Network and this center will showcase that work on the athletic fields but also promote the success of our student-athletes in our classrooms, in our laboratories and out in the world beyond Chapel Hill,” Guskiewicz said.</p>
<p>The interim chancellor added the new media and communications center will showcase the work of UNC student-athletes while also giving other Carolina students the opportunity to gain real-world sports broadcasting experience.</p>
<p>“Beyond athletics, this new center will be an academic tool or a teaching laboratory as I like to call it offering real-world content creation and production experiences to our student-journalists,” Guskiewicz said. “Academic units and departments will also use the advanced technology in this space and provide experiential education opportunities.”</p>
<p>The facility, which cost an estimated $15 million, is located next to the Smith Center and has been the subject of an extensive renovation project.</p>
<p>Whether fans will actually be able to watch the games and shows produced from this new facility has been its own point of consternation in recent months. Negotiations up to the launch of the network brought major attention as to how many customers would have access to the channel. The majority of carriers have now signed up to carry the channel, although negotiations are still ongoing between ESPN and some providers. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper even recently weighed in, encouraging providers and ESPN to come to agreements.</p>
