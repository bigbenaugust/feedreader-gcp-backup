The school district believes it will help improve safety and the staff’s ability to better help students.</p>
<p>The Minnesota-based company was created to help first responders see important information about vulnerable individuals, like those with autism or dementia. The contract with the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools district is their first where the technology will be implemented for a school system.</p>
<p>CHCCS Director of Safe Schools Scarlett Steinert said at the press conference for the announcement the district had been meeting with Vitals since December and worked directly with them on how their app would operate in a school setting.</p>
<p>“We came away with a strong belief that this technology would give our staff a powerful resource,” Steinart said, “designated to help them better understand the needs of students living with visible and not visible conditions or disabilities.”</p>
<p>Vitals technology works<a href="https://thevitalsapp.com/network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> predominantly through an app</a> and small beacons. Families can put information about their child into the app, volunteering whatever details about their student they wish to share. A beacon the child carries, which comes either as a keychain, card or tile, alerts someone who has the app once they are within 80 feet. The information provided by the parents pops up in the child’s profile, with a description of behaviors, disabilities and preferences.</p>

<p>Vitals’ Chief Communications Officer Stan Alleyne stressed that the school district is envisioning the resource for all students and parents who want staff to know their needs, not just students with disabilities. He said early implementation will be a learning process that will help find ways Vitals’ system can improve within schools.</p>
<p>“There’s no way adults can really know what’s going on,” said Alleyne. “There’s no way you can know if [suddenly] there are some anger issues that are cropping up, if there’s a divorce, if there’s some mental health concerns, or if their medications are changing. We’re going to run it with all this staff and all these students and really see how this works.”</p>
<p>CHCCS is implementing the technology by having principals, nurses, counselors and school resource officers download and actively use the app. The goal is to provide direct ways to access a student’s file and information to help de-escalate any situation.</p>
<p>Smith Middle School SRO Kurt Gurley said he’s excited this technology will be used through a phone app.</p>
<p>“There are times when I’m dealing with a situation, I need something and I need it right there,” said Gurley. “[I’m thinking] ‘how do I respond to this kid, what has worked in the past,’ and it may have just slipped my mind. But now I have it on my phone instead of going somewhere to get it, which is outstanding.”</p>
<p>CHCCS will be sending information out to parents soon about the Vitals network and how to participate. Implementation at Phoenix Academy High School will be the first phase of the technology’s rollout in the school district where all staff will have the app. Certain staff members at all other schools will use it shortly after.</p>

Tuesday&#8217;s discussions were much shorter than when the chambers debated and voted on their respective replacement maps for their own seats in recent days.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel ruled two weeks ago the 2017 districts drawn by the GOP-dominated legislature violated the state constitution. The judges had ordered fixes to be completed by Wednesday.</p>
<p>Redistricting plans aren&#8217;t subject to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper&#8217;s veto, but the judges will now review the plans with the help of an outside expert. The judges could sign off on the maps as they are or redraw some or all of the altered districts. A decision probably won&#8217;t be immediate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are optimistic that the way we&#8217;ve handled this is not just consistent with what the court directed us to do, but (was) within the spirit of what the court wanted us to do,&#8221; Senate leader Phil Berger said after the Senate&#8217;s party-line 24-21 vote for the House plan. Four Republicans were absent for the vote. The House later voted 62-52 for the Senate plan.</p>
<p>The final districts — redrawn to cover 14 counties or regional groupings for the House map and seven for the Senate map — would be used in the 2020 elections only.</p>
<p>A timeline set by the trial court allows legal briefs objecting to the replacement districts by Sept. 27, with any response to those objections filed by Oct. 4. Candidate filing begins in early December for next year&#8217;s elections, starting with early March primaries.</p>
<p>Common Cause, a plaintiff in the partisan gerrymandering lawsuit, mentioned the maps&#8217; approval in a news release but didn&#8217;t reveal whether it believes the maps comply with the court&#8217;s standards.</p>
<p>The legislature was barred from using partisan data and election results in drawing the plans. So it&#8217;s not immediately clear how the boundaries might affect Democrats&#8217; efforts to end Republican majorities in both chambers next year.</p>
<p>The judges also ordered legislators to &#8220;make reasonable efforts&#8221; to improve the compactness of districts being altered and reduce the number of voting precincts compared to the 2017 plans.</p>
<p>The redistricting process over the past week was done in open committees and before cameras that livestreamed the process on the General Assembly&#8217;s website — in keeping with demands from the judges for transparency. Senators said they were particularly pleased with their process, which led to more than half of the Democrats voting with nearly all Republicans for the Senate map.</p>
<p>The House map drew more complaints — particularly in the House. Democrats complained because GOP leaders in both chambers decided to initiate the changes from a large collections of sample maps created by a redistricting expert for the plaintiffs. They said the boundaries drawn by Jowei Chen of the University of Michigan were never designed to be actually used.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a false premise to start with that map to begin with,&#8221; said Rep. Deb Butler, a New Hanover County Democrat, while debating the Senate proposal Tuesday. Republicans said the judges&#8217; emphasis on Chen&#8217;s maps in their order led them to believe those lines will be upheld. Alterations were made to avoid putting pairs of incumbents in the same districts, which the court said they could consider.</p>
<p>One critic said House districts in Cumberland County looked too much like the 2017 districts. Senate redistricting co-chair Paul Newton, a Cabarrus County Republican, called that criticism a &#8220;bit of a stretch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll let the court sort that out,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The new resource of UNC’s Counseling and Psychological Services, <a href="https://caps.unc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or CAPS</a>, came at the recommendation from the university’s Mental Health Task Force. The 24/7 crisis support line will be accessible using CAPS’ current phone line and connects those calling to counselors at ProtoCall, a 24-hour hotline that provides around-the-clock mental health support.</p>
<p>Allen O’Barr, the director of CAPS, says the service is meant to be for students in need of support or crisis intervention outside of CAPS’ regular business hours.</p>
<p>“We were not really providing as good of a service as we could have provided and are now providing through ProtoCall,” says O’Barr. “The benefit of this service is that we have mental health counselors available after [business] hours for students to call directly. That’s really the state-of-the-art treatment for students in distress.”</p>
<p>Many campuses use 24/7 crisis support lines as a method for helping students cope with mental health problems. Interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Jonathan Sauls says UNC regularly examines how other schools are addressing students’ mental health, and the new hotline is no different. He also says that any after-hours call to ProtoCall will not go unaddressed by CAPS’ staff. The hotline professional will record notes that are sent to CAPS to access the following day.</p>
<p>Sauls says CAPS will still have an on-call staff member for more immediate mental health emergencies.</p>
<p>“If there’s some more urgent crisis that requires some in-person care,” he says, “CAPS will continue to have an on-call person that can have dialogue with that provider, and we can facilitate some in-person care as well.”</p>
<p>The Mental Health Task Force was <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/unc-working-to-address-mental-health-issues-on-campuses-across-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created in the spring of 2018</a> by former Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Bob Blouin. They championed the task force as a method to address mental health care needs of UNC students amidst a growing awareness of mental health struggles throughout higher education. The group submitted nearly 60 recommendations to the university in April, one suggesting to “improve accessibility and ease of navigability” of the CAPS model.</p>
<p>O’Barr says a variety of reasons are causing the need for more accessibility and the overall rise in mental health treatment for students.</p>
<p>“Clearly, there has been a decrease in stigma,” he says. “There has also been an increase in distress over the last five to 10 years. We’ve seen that not just in college counseling centers but globally and nationally.”</p>

<p>Both sets of maps must be approved by both chambers by Wednesday to comply with a state court ruling that declared 2017 boundaries violated the state constitution. A three-judge panel<span> </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/8925fafddb364cb8bed1561bf27aedad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a><span> </span>Sept. 3 that Republicans carved districts with extreme partisanship in mind, making it nearly impossible for Democrats to win a majority of seats in the House or Senate.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, many of the more than 50 speakers at a joint House-Senate public hearing about the proposed district lines said the process has improved over the past but remained split on whether the replacement maps are any better than the old gerrymandered ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are participating in the most transparent redistricting process in the history of our state,&#8221; said Sen. Warren Daniel, a Burke County Republican and Senate redistricting panel co-chairman.</p>
<p>But it was the judges who mandated transparency after evidence that the Republican&#8217;s now-deceased mapmaking consultant drew most of the 2017 districts several weeks before lawmakers met to discuss and vote on them.</p>
<p>That openness, the judges wrote, required &#8220;all map drawing to occur at public hearings, with any relevant computer screen visible to legislators and public observers.&#8221; The redistricting committee meetings and desktop screens were livestreamed.</p>
<p>Even some Democratic senators critical of Republican redistricting this decade said during floor debate they were pleased with how the chamber reached consensus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your decisions were defensible. You did appear to me to be acting in good faith and that&#8217;s remarkable &#8230; and you deserve recognition for that,&#8221; said Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Mecklenburg County Democrat. Although Jackson still voted against the Senate plan — citing longstanding support for creating an outside commission to draw maps — 13 of the chamber&#8217;s 21 Democrats voted yes.</p>
<p>Some public hearing speakers said the process was still hard to follow. Committee meetings last week sometimes were delayed for hours, and more public hearings were needed.</p>
<p>The judges said GOP mapmakers couldn&#8217;t use partisan data or past election results — a key indicator of electoral performance — in fashioning maps in the latest round of redistricting.</p>
<p>The committees instead decided to use districts created by an expert for plaintiffs who successfully sued over the 2017 lines as the basis for their work. The judges gave the district maps from University of Michigan professor Jowei Chen great weight in their ruling.</p>
<p>Some Democrats said Chen&#8217;s maps were never created to be used as actual districts. And some of Monday&#8217;s speakers said they were tainted when House and Senate members agreed to tweak them to ensure pairs of current incumbents aren&#8217;t living in the same districts. That would require them to run against each other in the 2020 elections.</p>
<p>The judges said incumbency protection could be considered if drawing the maps. Renee Sekel of Cary told lawmakers they were still violating the spirit of the judges&#8217; directive. She also noted that the incumbents were elected under maps found to be unlawful this decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re choosing to protect incumbents who court after court after court has told you are not illegally elected,&#8221; Sekel said. &#8220;You need to stop it. That&#8217;s as simple as it can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other hearing participants tried to pitch last-minute changes to House districts. Some complained that the cities of High Point and Concord were split between districts. Several Columbus County leaders and residents asked to reverse changes to a district that crosses into Robeson County.</p>
<p>House Republicans have said it&#8217;s possible the map approved by the chamber last Friday could be altered in the Senate.</p>
<p>The enacted plans will be forwarded to the three-judge panel, which has chosen a third-party expert to review the districts and redraw them if the judges believe the replacement maps don&#8217;t meet their standards. The final maps would be used next year only, because the next round of redistricting begins in 2021.</p>

<p>No matter what it tasted like.</p>
<p>Instead, the basketball hall of famer and owner of the Charlotte Hornets teamed up with owners from the Celtics, Lakers and Bucks to create an ultra-premium blend of the agave liquor that has already won prizes at tasting competitions from New York to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the ownership group. It&#8217;s not a celebrity-endorsed brand,&#8221; said Emilia Fazzalari, the CEO of Cincoro Tequila and the wife of Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck. &#8220;It was never about that. For us, it has always been about the liquid first.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea came about three years ago, when Jordan bonded over a love of tequila while having dinner with Grousbeck, Fazzalari, Los Angeles Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and Milwaukee Bucks owner Wes Edens.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted this tequila that tasted great,&#8221; Fazzalari said in a telephone interview Monday. &#8220;We are competitors on the court. We stand across from each other and compete throughout the season. But we are collaborators by nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The basketball magnates didn&#8217;t just write a check and then watch from afar.</p>
<p>Jordan was involved in the design of the bottle, working with Mark Smith, the vice president of innovation special projects at Nike. They came up with a five-sided crystal container — a reference to the five leaves of the agave plant — that tilts up at a 23-degree angle — a nod to Jordan&#8217;s uniform number.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael&#8217;s influence was really as a true tequila lover and a person who only does things right,&#8221; Grousbeck said.</p>
<p>Edens brought knowledge of supply chain logistics to the group. There were weekly conference calls, and meetings. Together the partners tasted 1,000 different blends before settling on a flavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the partners are actively involved in the company, and we all have been from Day 1,&#8221; Fazzalari said. &#8220;They&#8217;re not silent partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cincoro is bottling four different tequilas, starting with the unaged Blanco that sells for $70. A limited edition Extra Añejo, aged 40-44 months, is listed at $1,600 and comes in a black crystal bottle that is inlaid with real gold.</p>
<p>According to Russ Pareti, Cincoro&#8217;s chief marketing officer, the tequila market is growing by 10% a year. But the ultra-luxury market is expanding by 40% annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s really a large runway,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Fazzalari would not disclose specific sales or reveal production numbers, except to say they have sold out in some of the 12 U.S. markets they have launched in so far. They hope to be in all 50 states next year, and then take it to Asia and Europe, Grousbeck said.</p>
<p>Grousbeck said NBA owners have been known to go into business together before, on occasion investing in the same company or fund. But he could not recall a time where four or more teams have joined up on a project.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty rare,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there is a good bond among team principals in general.&#8221;</p>

<p>The 20-member search committee was announced at the Board of Trustees meeting in August and began work on identifying candidates earlier this month, according to a message sent by the university on behalf of Richard Stevens – who is chairing the Board of Trustees and the search committee.</p>
<p>The first opportunity for public input is set for Tuesday, September 17, from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Frank Porter Graham Student Union auditorium and the second will follow the next day from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Pleasants Room at Wilson Library.</p>
<p>Stevens, at that August meeting of the board, listed some of the qualities he feels would make a good selection for the next chancellor.</p>
<p>“We want someone who is innovative, who is a visionary, who will do a very good job for this university,” Stevens said.</p>
<p>Stevens also thanked interim chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz at that meeting.</p>
<p>Guskiewicz took over after a tumultuous conclusion to the tenure of former chancellor Carol Folt. Protesters pulled down the Confederate monument on the campus known as Silent Sam on the first day of classes in the fall of 2018. That set off months of tension on the campus and between the university administration and the UNC System Board of Governors. Folt ordered the removal of Silent Sam’s remaining base in mid-January of this year. At the same time, she offered her resignation effective at the end of the academic year. The system board accelerated that timeline to the end of January. System president Bill Roper, who himself is serving in an interim capacity, then appointed Guskiewicz the interim chancellor.</p>
<p>Guskiewicz has expressed a continued interest in serving as chancellor full time.</p>
<p>Stevens said the search committee was hoping to work expeditiously. That committee will ultimately recommend three finalists to the campus Board of Trustees, which can either accept or reject the nominations. If accepted, the nominations would be sent to Roper, who will make one recommendation to the system Board of Governors.</p>
<p>Public input can also be submitted on the <a href="https://chancellorsearch.unc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website established for the search</a>.</p>

<p>Louis Tortora announced his decision to drop out of the race on his campaign and personal Facebook pages over the weekend.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, some in our district feel that donating to a political candidate that doesn’t align with their views is akin to a scandal,” Tortora wrote, “and the negative conversation surrounding this is distracting all of us from the kids I aim to serve.”</p>
<p>Tortora did attempt to distance himself from the president.</p>
<p>“To be clear: I have no political affiliation with President Trump, and I do not personally support his policies, the way he has handled public education or his treatment of people.”</p>
<p>A search of Tortora’s name on <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opensecrets.org</a>, which is a product of the Center for Responsive Politics, shows two donations &#8211; $250 each – going to Trump from Louis Tortora with a Chapel Hill address and 27517 zip code. The first was in September 2016 and a second in September 2018.</p>
<p>Tortora’s address on his candidate filing paperwork does list his address in the 27517 zip code.</p>
<p>North Carolina voting records show that Tortora has voted in the general election in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 as well as the 2015 municipal election. He also voted in the Democratic primary leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Tortora is also registered as a Democrat, according to state documents.</p>
<p>“I have been relentless in my dedication to improving our school system for the past five year[s],” Tortora wrote. “However, we live in a small community, and these negative attacks take their toll not just on me, but on my family.”</p>
<p>Tortora dropping out of the race comes after some community members directly asked Tortora on Facebook whether he donated money to the Trump campaign. He did not provide a direct response to those inquiries.</p>
<p>“I love our community and I care deeply about giving every kid a strong education foundation,” Tortora wrote. “As a parent, I will continue to practice tolerance, compassion and respect for the different life experiences of others, and I hope you will join me in setting that example for our community and our kids.”</p>
<p>Tortora is the second candidate to drop out of the race for school board. Carmen Huerta-Bapat dropped out of the race earlier this year due to medical concerns.</p>
<p>Five candidates remain for the four seats up for election to the CHCCS board this fall. Early voting is scheduled to start October 16 and Election Day is November 5.</p>
<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that both donations were in the lead up to the 2016 election. The donations came in September 2016 and September 2018. The story was changed to correct that error.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://carolinaconnection.org/2019/09/14/is-this-silent-sam-unc-officials-wont-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolina Connection</a> reporter Charlotte Ix says her roommate tipped her off that the Confederate monument may be at UNC-owned storage facility off of Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard. According to the story, Ix found stone slabs, what appeared to be a metal figure wrapped in a brown tarp and a tall rectangle wrapped in blue tarp when she investigated the location. She says she believes the covered objects are the statue and its pedestal.</p>
<p>The Connection report says Ix contacted UNC&#8217;s Director of Media Relations <span>Joanne Peters Denny to confirm whether the location is where the statue is being kept. Denny responded in an email saying,</span><span> “I am unable to identify what is in the photo,” when examining photos Ix had taken.</span></p>
<p>According to Ix, when she returned to the location following inquiry to UNC, a police officer was guarding the area. When visited by Chapelboro staff, a UNC Police car was also at the site.</p>
<p>The location of the statue has been a mystery since its removal from UNC&#8217;s McCorkle Place. The bronze figure atop the monument was <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/protesters-rally-silent-sam-ahead-unc-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toppled by protesters</a> in August 2018, who contend the statue is a symbol of white supremacy. The base of the statue was <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/unc-moves-quickly-removes-silent-sam-pedestal-on-folts-authorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed in January 2019</a> under the order of former UNC chancellor Carol Folt. She said she authorized it because threats to the community &#8220;<span>continued to grow and place our community at serious risk&#8221; with the statue&#8217;s presence. Folt also announced the same day she would <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/carol-folt-stepping-down-as-unc-chancellor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">step down from her position</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Five members of the UNC System&#8217;s Board of Governors were assigned to work with the campus to develop a plan regarding the monument&#8217;s future. After deadlines for a plan to come forward have been delayed twice, however, no timeframe of when a decision could be announced has emerged.</span></p>

<p>Law enforcement officials found 33-year-old Deshawn Maurice Perry, of Durham, dead in the far-right travel lane of the northbound lanes of the interstate. Officials said that it appeared Perry had changed a flat tire “and was in the process of gathering his tools when he was struck by an unknown vehicle.”</p>
<p>There is no suspect vehicle description or information regarding any possible damage to the suspect vehicle at this time.</p>
<p>Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to call the State Highway Patrol’s Orange County office at (919) 732-2551 during business hours or any time at 1-800-334-7411.</p>

<p>Chatham&#8217;s commissioners voted 4-1 in August to ask a United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter to have a plan by Oct. 1 to remove the statute. The county let the UDC install the statute in 1907. Without a plan, the county will declare it a public trespass by Nov. 1, making it eligible for removal.</p>
<p>Monument supporter Barry Isenhour said the statue respects American veterans, but opponent Robert Finch said it was installed to intimidate the black community.</p>

<p>The three-judge Superior Court panel on Friday appointed Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily to check the state General Assembly&#8217;s revisions. He may also redraw legislative districts himself if the judges decide legislators didn&#8217;t follow guidelines the court outlined earlier this month.</p>
<p>Persily served as a special master to a federal court panel that ruled in 2016 that more than two dozen of North Carolina&#8217;s 170 legislative districts approved in 2011 were illegal racial gerrymanders. The maps were revised by legislators in 2017, but the state judges ruled those districts were political gerrymanders.</p>
<p>Legislators have until Wednesday to complete their remedial maps.</p>

<p>A Chapel Hill &#8211; Carrboro City Schools elementary school is on lockdown Friday after reports of sounds similar to gunshots near Frank Porter Graham Bilingue Elementary School.</p>
<p>&#8220;These sounds were off campus, but near enough to be heard,&#8221; district officials said.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported on the school campus, but the school has been placed on lockdown while Chapel Hill Police investigate, according to a post on the district&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>

<p>Medline Industries, a distributor and manufacturer of medical supplies, will build a $65 million facility in the <a href="https://growinorangenc.com/land-opportunities/development-districts/buckhorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buckhorn Economic Development District</a> near Mebane. Representatives from the company, the state’s commerce department, Orange County and the City of Mebane all joined to make official their approval of Medline.</p>
<p>North Carolina Secretary of Commerce Tony Copeland said the state is excited over the economic opportunities the 1.2 million-square-foot facility will bring both to the region and North Carolina as a whole. He highlighted the proximity to the Research Triangle and the state’s location on the eastern seaboard as a big resource for Medline.</p>
<p>“We’re an eight-hour drive from 80 percent of the customers in America,” said Copeland. “This is basically a logistics hub for distribution. But also, we have a workforce second-to-none. Think of all the customer access they have in this area, with all the medical assets we have [in the Research Triangle].”</p>
<p>Medline says it expects to create 250 new jobs in its first five years. If this facility follows similar tracks to its others in the region, the company could reach 600 jobs over its first 10 years. Economic incentives have been put in place with yearly benchmarks for the new center, with the company receiving more than <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/orange-county-commissioners-holding-public-hearing-on-economic-development-incentives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 million in tax incentives</a> from Orange County over the course of five years. Medline is also in line for $1.725 million from the state and $803,000 from Mebane in incentives.</p>
<p>Medline’s vice president of corporate communications Blair Klein described the purpose of the facility, saying the expansion to the region is about making healthcare operate smoothly.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s a just-in-time delivery to a local hospital system for supplies or a routine weekly distribution to physician offices, the employees and team members of this location will be fulfilling those orders,” Klein said. “They’ll be picking them, packaging them and driving them. All of the employees in this area that we’ll be hiring locally will be contributing to that larger healthcare mission.”</p>
<p>Mebane mayor Glendel Stephenson shared some remarks at the announcement, saying Mebane is grateful and excited Medline has chosen to be by their city. Stephenson also hinted that more economic development projects are on the way for the region.</p>
<p>“I believe today is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Stephenson. “Regarding the financial return on the investment we’ve made on water and sewer connections [around the Buckhorn district] over the last number of years, I think it’s paying off. I don’t believe it’s too hard to visualize multiple announcements coming in the months and years ahead for this particular area.”</p>
<p>Construction on the site for Medline’s distribution facility is slated to begin in October, with the facility opening in late 2020.</p>

<p>The tale of &#8220;Eno the Emu&#8221; became famous worldwide as the flightless bird <a href="https://chapelboro.com/town-square/eno-the-emu-eludes-authorities-draws-national-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eluded capture attempts</a> from authorities for months. The bird was <a href="https://chapelboro.com/town-square/report-multiple-emu-sightings-in-chatham-orange-counties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially spotted in Chatham County</a>, but traveled north to Hillsborough where it was seen several times.</p>
<p>Media outlets such as CNN, the New York Times, and HuffPost even picked up on the story.</p>
<p>Orange County embraced the hype surrounding &#8220;Eno the Emu.&#8221; <span>The Chapel Hill/Orange County Visitors Bureau incorporated &#8220;Eno&#8221; into its advertising campaign and the Expedition School in Hillsborough <a href="https://chapelboro.com/town-square/orange-county-embraces-eno-the-emu-craze" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned the emu into a teachable moment</a> for its students.</span></p>

<p>Although animal control services reached out to known emu owners in the area, no one came forward to claim responsibility for &#8220;Eno.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan to capture the emu, developed in conjunction with a board-certified avian veterinarian and two specialists from the North Carolina Zoo, who were present throughout the attempt, involved sedating the bird to make it easy to transport it.</p>
<p>The bird did not respond to the low dose of sedatives, Marotto said, but eventually suffered &#8220;an event&#8221; while being restrained and died. The team tried to revive the bird through CPR but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>“Everyone is devastated,” Marotto said.</p>
<p>“We were concerned it could come out on the roadway and cause an accident or be injured itself, and we were also concerned with the opening of hunting season. We didn’t feel leaving it alone was a viable option.”</p>

<p>The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is conducting a homicide investigation after 46-year-old Anne H. Kirkpatrick was found dead in her front yard in Hurdle Mills on Sunday afternoon. Authorities said on Thursday when announcing the reward that Kirkpatrick died “after a violent assault.”</p>
<p>An off-duty deputy who lives near Kirkpatrick found her body lying in the yard.</p>
<p>“We have been working this case since Sunday. The kind of work involved in a case like this is complicated, but we will get there,” Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood said in a release. “That said, someone knows something that will help us get there more quickly. Anne Kirkpatrick deserves justice. We want to provide that for her, for her family, and for this community as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Authorities have released very few details on the case at this time. Court documents show Kirkpatrick had taken out <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/crime/court-woman-had-taken-out-restraining-orders-before-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restraining orders</a> against two men before she was killed.</p>
<p>Officials asked anyone with information on the case to call lead investigator Zach Baldwin at (919) 245-2939.</p>

<p>That process takes a step forward Thursday as Chatham County’s Board of Elections is set to vote to recommend a new voting machine system for the county to the Board of Commissioners.</p>
<p>Wednesday, residents had the opportunity to check out the three potential options county officials will choose from at an event in Pittsboro’s Agriculture and Conference Center.</p>
<p>Vickie Shea, a 14-year county resident and member of the League of Women Voters, said she had been following the recent decisions around voting systems in North Carolina and was there to see the machines in action.</p>
<p>“We’ve been following this issue of voting machines for quite a while, have attended the state board meetings and the local board meetings and wanted to have a chance to see the machines in all of their details and complexity,” She said.</p>
<p>The Director of Chatham’s Board of Elections Pandora Paschal was at the event as well. She said the board will meet Thursday to debate over the three voting systems presented, and that it is possible they might finalize their recommendations for the county commissioners.</p>
<p>The three voting systems are made by companies Clear Ballot, ES&amp;S and Hart InterCivic.</p>
<p>Shea said her preferred method of voting is with pen and paper, like she use to do when she was younger. But after reviewing the options on show Wednesday, she said she felt a lot better about the new voting machines.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that all of the vendors take election security seriously, although the ways they approach that are different,&#8221; She said. &#8220;So it’s important to talk to each of them.”</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s Board of Elections meeting is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at the board office on Thompson Street in Pittsboro.</p>

A $25 million donation has led to the rebranding of the school and a reinforcement of the lessons its teaching students.<br />
<u></u></p>
<p>The gift from newspaper publisher Walter Hussman Jr. and his wife Ben led to a name-change from the UNC School of Media and Journalism to the <a href="http://hussman.unc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media</a>.</p>
<p>Hussman, an alumnus of the journalism school in 1968, says he was driven to make the gift because his publications’ and personal values align with the school’s in a precarious era of journalism.</p>
<p>“It’s time for someone to really stand up for objectivity and lack of bias in news reporting and editing,” says Hussman. “It’s really resonating with people. We thought [this gift] would, but when you see it in actuality, it’s very impressive.”</p>
<p>Hussman is the publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and CEO of his own media company, which owns daily newspapers and cable television stations in Arkansas, Texas and Tennessee. For his papers, his <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/corevalues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instills core values</a> of impartiality and credibility.</p>
<p>Dean of the school Susan King says Hussman’s commitment is a reinforcement of those values within the journalism school and serves as a signal to the broader journalism community.</p>
<p>“Every student who comes into our school learns the fundamental building block of information in America that’s kept us free: the first amendment rights of free speech in a democracy,” says King. “With Walter Hussman making an investment in us, he underscores the importance of that fundamental building block of every student’s experience here.”</p>
<p>Kings says she is honored Hussman has chosen to invest in UNC students and her school, seeing it as an optimistic gesture toward reverting journalism away from partisanship.</p>
<p>“I think Walter Hussman is making a statement,” she says, “that UNC is a center where information does make us free and is a university where students are learning how to lead the conversation in America that will make us stronger.”</p>
<p>Hussman says he is encouraged by the positive reaction he’s seen from the gift’s announcement. He says others should donate to journalism and publications they feel strongly about, and that there are ways to support fair journalism even without spending money.</p>
<p>“I think the way people can support [these values] is to speak out,” Hussman says. “They can use their social media accounts; they can write letters to their editors and say, ‘this is what we’re in favor of.’”</p>
<p>The $25 million gift to the Hussman School of Journalism and Media is undesignated. King says her initial plan is to use the funding to invest in faculty and opportunities for students. Hussman&#8217;s gift comes just less than a year since Don Curtis <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/unc/20-million-gift-supporting-new-unc-media-school">pledged a $21 million donation</a> to different facets of the university, a part of which was the largest single gift to the journalism school at the time.</p>

Roy Cooper&#8217;s veto of the state budget bill, prompting accusations of trickery and deception from Cooper and fellow Democrats.</p>
<p>Republican leaders had spent months trying to persuade enough Democrats to meet the threshold for an override, and finally seized a moment when most opposing Democrats weren&#8217;t at their seats. The few Democrats who were on the House floor moments before the initial 55-9 vote erupted in protest, accusing Republican Speaker Tim Moore of tricking the chamber about the day&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The override isn&#8217;t complete — the Senate still must hold a vote on the issue — but Republicans there need only one Democrat to join them to secure victory. Any Senate absences by Democrats also could make that easier.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a tragedy. This is a travesty of the process and you know it,&#8221; Rep. Deb Butler, a New Hanover County Democrat, yelled at Moore just before the vote began. &#8220;Mr. Speaker, how dare you, Mr. Speaker!&#8221;</p>
<p>Moore told her that he &#8220;did not advise that there would be no votes this morning.&#8221; Moore&#8217;s office provided audio from Tuesday&#8217;s floor session from House Rules Committee Chairman David Lewis saying recorded votes would occur Wednesday, specifically identifying two different spending measures.</p>
<p>Still, in a fiery early-afternoon news conference, Cooper maintained that Democrats were misled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look at the number of people who were in that chamber and how many of them were Republicans and how many of them were Democrats. There&#8217;s no confusion about what happened here. This was a lie, and we know why they were not there because they were told that there were not going to be votes,&#8221; Cooper said.</p>
<p>Cooper accused Republicans of pulling &#8220;their most deceptive stunt yet&#8221; at a time of day when many North Carolinians were focused on honoring those killed in the 9/11 attacks. Only one House Democrat has said he was attending a memorial service at the time of the session, however.</p>
<p>The House budget override vote has been on the daily floor calendar since early July, and from time to time the Republican leadership had announced that there would be no recorded votes on certain days. There is nothing in the chamber rules to prevent such action Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Moore reiterated that there was no scheming to create the opportunity for an override. He noted that he had said ever since Cooper&#8217;s budget veto in late June that he would look for ways to get the budget enacted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I see an opportunity to override this budget this veto, I was going to take that vote,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;I checked when we came in. Of course, we saw that we had the numbers to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minority Leader Darren Jackson said he believed House Rules Committee Chairman David Lewis told him any recorded votes Wednesday would be delayed until the afternoon. Lewis said that wasn&#8217;t accurate. He said Moore had the authority to decide.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s dispute marked the latest battle in a decadelong fight between Republicans who took over the General Assembly in 2011 and Democrats whose party had largely controlled state government for more than a century. Democrats have regained some power with Cooper&#8217;s election in 2016 and ended the GOP supermajority in the House last year by gaining enough legislative seats to prevent veto overrides when the chamber is full.</p>
<p>The two parties also have battled over redistricting maps that lawmakers this week are now trying to redraw after a court struck down dozens of districts due to extreme Republican bias.</p>
<p>Cooper vetoed the budget on June 28, saying the two-year spending plan lacks Medicaid expansion for hundreds of thousands of low-income adults, contains paltry raises for teachers and unnecessarily gives corporations additional tax reductions. The veto and lack of an override had led to an 11-week budget impasse.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s vote was called quickly, giving dozens of absent Democrats little time to reach the floor. Jackson also said that several Democrats who were on the floor were denied the chance to debate the measure.</p>
<p>Moore &#8220;kept talking over us. He turned off our mics,&#8221; Rep. Mary Belk, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, said at a news conference. She and others went to other desks to use the microphones. As Butler and others continued to blast Moore&#8217;s actions from the floor, the speaker threatened that he could order Butler removed. Several Capitol police officers entered the chamber, and Democratic lawmakers surrounded Butler, who refused to yield.</p>
<p>One Democratic lawmaker took a video of the exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;The unseemly lack of leadership is incredible, absolutely cowardice, childishness,&#8221; Butler said as Moore called for an override vote, on a separate Cooper veto, which also succeeded.</p>

<p>Chapel Hill High School students and staff have been relocated from one of the buildings on campus due to a reported gas leak.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill &#8211; Carrboro City Schools district officials said Wednesday morning that a gas leak occurred &#8220;on the back part of the CHHS campus near the tennis courts.&#8221; Everyone is safe, officials said, &#8220;and the construction team is working to get the situation resolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Fire crews are on the scene.</p>
<p>Students and staff were moved from the B building on campus to the A building temporarily and will move back and continue the school day as planned once the all clear is given.</p>
<p>The gas leak prompted Seawell Elementary School and Smith Middle School to be placed on temporary soft lockdowns.</p>
<p>Construction has been ongoing at Chapel Hill High School as part of a major renovation to the campus.</p>
<p>There is no time estimation for the gas leak to be resolved immediately available.</p>

<p>The approximately 39-acre property has housed the mall since the 1970s. Two other buildings are located on the site, where Chapel Hill Tire, Harris Teeter and K&amp;W Cafeteria are located, along with surface-level parking. Ram Realty, a branch of Ram Development, purchased the mall in late 2018 and announced plans this spring for a “multi-phase” effort to “modernize the property and create a true town center for Chapel Hill.”</p>
<p>The concept plan recently submitted to the Town of Chapel Hill calls for a portion of the existing mall to be removed and replaced with a “central gathering area and pedestrian access.” New structures are proposed for the site as well.</p>
<p>“Where new buildings are constructed, the intention is to bring these buildings closer to the surrounding street to be more compliant with the Town of Chapel Hill’s form-based standards,” according to the proposal.</p>
<p>Three-story commercial or office space could front Estes Drive with buildings reaching five to seven stories throughout the rest of the site. The proposal also calls for hotel and residential units in addition to the office space. The town has already been in discussion with Ram Realty on possibly locating the future Chapel Hill Police station on the site fronting Willow Drive. A parking deck could also be located on the Willow Drive side of the property.</p>
<p>The site is sure to be scrutinized for any potential development due to past flooding issues around the area. A traffic impact analysis would also be required, if the project were to move forward.</p>
<p>A concept plan is not a formal development application. But the town council and advisory boards can provide feedback to initial thoughts for development.</p>
<p>There is no timeline for the start of that review process <a href="https://www.townofchapelhill.org/town-hall/departments-services/planning-and-development-services/development-activity-report/unversity-mall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the town’s website</a>.</p>
<p>WCHL moved its studios to University Place in October 2016.</p>

<p>Authorities said Tuesday that 36-year-old Jermaine Andrew Ramsey was arrested on Saturday in Guilford County at Piedmont Triad International Airport and charged with a felony count of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.</p>
<p>Officials from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office said in a release that Ramsey is accused of shooting “a longtime friend on his,” 42-year-old Jarrid Brooks, early last Thursday morning on Rencher Street just outside of the Hillsborough town limits.</p>
<p>Brooks “is recovering from a .40 caliber gunshot wound to the face,” according to the sheriff’s office. “Investigators believe Ramsey shot Brooks after an argument escalated.”</p>
<p>Ramsey was given a $200,000 bond, according to law enforcement, and he is scheduled to be back in Orange County court on October 7.</p>

<p>News outlets report 46-year-old Anne H. Kirkpatrick sought the first restraining order on July 19 against a man she had dated or was dating. That was followed by a second restraining order against another man identified as her husband nearly one week later. Court documents indicate Kirkpatrick said the second man threatened her.</p>
<p>An off-duty sheriff&#8217;s deputy who lives nearby found Kirkpatrick&#8217;s body in front of her home on Sunday. Authorities aren&#8217;t releasing details on how she died. The sheriff&#8217;s office is investigating the case as a homicide.</p>

<p>The Board of Orange County Commissioners will hold a public hearing Tuesday to discuss an economic incentive package for Medline Industries. <u></u>Medline, an Illinois-based manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies, is eyeing a 172-acre site off West Ten Road. The area is in Orange County’s <a href="https://growinorangenc.com/land-opportunities/development-districts/buckhorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buckhorn Economic Development District</a>, which is land designated for manufacturing, wholesale and retail uses.</p>
<p>Orange County is considering a performance-based economic package to incentivize Medline building on the site. Medline say it expects to create 250 new jobs in its first five years and could reach 600 jobs in its first 10. If the new factory meets yearly benchmarks of jobs created, the company would receive more than $1.8 million in tax incentives over the course of five years. The company is also in line for $1.725 million from the state and $803,000 from Mebane in incentives.</p>
<p>Chair of the Board of Orange County Commissioners Penny Rich spoke with <a href="https://chapelboro.com/the-aaron-keck-show/conversations-with-the-mayors-podcast/orange-county-kkk-rally-economic-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCHL’s Aaron Keck</a> recently about the economic projects the county is planning. She said the county has multiple development projects in the works, with this Medline project coming just two months after <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/orange-county-passes-incentives-for-abbs-new-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the board approved incentives</a> for Swiss manufacturer ABB.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited,” said Rich. “I think job creation is something we’ve been trying to do in Orange County for a really long time, and we’re finally doing it. I can check that off from my box. I’ve been a county commissioner for almost eight years, and we keep [stressing] economic development. And here we are, we got it.”</p>
<p>The $65.3 million project would create a 1.2 million-square-foot distribution center, where Medline medical supplies would be shipped to hospitals, healthcare providers, EMS agencies and more.</p>
<p>If Medline builds the facility near Mebane, it will be the company’s second location in the state. A distribution center in Lincolnton, has been operating since 2013.</p>
<p>The public hearing on the performance-based economic incentives will be held at the Southern Human Services building at 7 p.m. It will be followed by a work session by the Orange County commissioners.</p>

<p>The House and Senate redistricting committees met to figure how they would enact new boundaries for the 2020 election by a court-mandated Sept. 18 deadline. Last week, a three-judge panel<span> </span><a href="https://apnews.com/8925fafddb364cb8bed1561bf27aedad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a><span> </span>Republican mapmakers violated the state constitution by manipulating districts created in 2017 to help elect a maximum number of GOP candidates and make it nearly impossible for Democrats to win majorities.</p>
<p>Republicans have held legislative majorities since 2011 and have been sued repeatedly this decade over electoral maps they&#8217;ve drawn. They disagree with the unanimous decision from state court. But they are not appealing the ruling, which orders that election results and other partisan data like voter registration be omitted from the process of shaping districts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;an unprecedented moment in the history of redistricting in North Carolina,&#8221; said Sen. Paul Newton, a Cabarrus County Republican and Senate redistricting committee co-chairman. &#8220;Never before has this legislature been ordered not to consider partisanship in drawing maps &#8230; the rules of the road have now changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The<span> </span><a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/18-CVS-14001_Final-Judgment.pdf?Bwsegeo1VV20zhJsp9hoClvmoRp3A6AR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruling</a><span> </span>came barely two months after the U.S. Supreme Court decided partisan gerrymandering was not the purview of federal courts, but suggested it could still be acted upon by state courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the justices in Washington, D.C., won&#8217;t protect people&#8217;s constitutional rights — won&#8217;t ensure that all voters have a fair opportunity to participate in our democracy — then the courts of North Carolina will fix the problem themselves,&#8221; said Stanton Jones, a chief lawyer in the lawsuit filed by Common Cause, the state Democratic Party and Democratic voters.</p>
<p>Jones and others spoke at a news conference before the committee meetings in which they urged GOP lawmakers to fully carry out the court&#8217;s demands. The court said remapping of 57 House districts and 21 Senate districts must be conducted &#8220;in full public view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three judges cited evidence from the files of now-deceased Republican mapmaker Thomas Hofeller to declare he privately drew most of the 2017 House and Senate districts several weeks before lawmakers actually set mapmaking criteria.</p>
<p>Republicans have &#8220;mastered the art of gerrymandering in a truly diabolical way,&#8221; said Derrick Miller of Wilmington, a plaintiff in the case.</p>
<p>Republican redistricting leaders proposed separately in Monday&#8217;s committee meetings that replacement districts be based on a set of 1,000 simulated House and Senate maps generated by Jowei Chen, a University of Michigan redistricting expert who testified for the plaintiffs in the July trial. The judges appeared to find persuasive Chen&#8217;s findings that the 2017 maps displayed Republican bias, compared to the maps he generated by computer that left out partisan and racial considerations.</p>
<p>Under the GOP proposals, only districts generated by Chen that scored best on principles like compactness and minimizing split voting precincts and municipal boundaries would be considered. Amendments could be considered to ensure pairs of incumbents aren&#8217;t placed in the same proposed district, forcing them to compete against one another for reelection.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we choose any of Dr. Chen&#8217;s modeling runs, we know that our base map will be a compliant map, a fair map in the eyes of the court,&#8221; Newton said. Democrats on the committees generally supported using Chen&#8217;s maps, given the time crunch, but others raised cautions about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public scrutiny is upon this process,&#8221; said Rep. Deb Butler, a New Hanover County Democrat. Details were being hashed out late Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>The final House and Senate maps would have to be approved by both chambers. Redistricting plans aren&#8217;t subject to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper&#8217;s veto.</p>
<p>Exactly how or whether new maps would improve Democratic chances to take back majorities in 2020 aren&#8217;t immediately clear. Democrats would need to win six additional House seats or five Senate seats to flip one or both chambers. Whichever parties win majorities in 2020 will control the once-a-decade redistricting the following year.</p>

The county is discussing potential changes to address some residents’ complaints over the noise and proximity of gunfire. Concerns from residents on Hatch Road about gunfire were brought to the commissioners <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/residents-take-disturbing-gunfire-noise-complaint-to-orange-county-commissioners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late June</a>.</p>
<p>Board chair Penny Rich spoke with <a href="https://chapelboro.com/the-aaron-keck-show/conversations-with-the-mayors-podcast/orange-county-guns-race-and-hurricanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCHL’s Aaron Keck</a> following that meeting and said she wanted to distinguish for residents that the commissioners are not considering a gun ordinance, since that’s against state law. It’s more likely noise, density or safety-related changes could be discussed at the upcoming work session on Tuesday. Rich also stated any changes would be made in neighborhoods in unincorporated portions of the county and not in more rural areas.</p>
<p>“It’s loud when you’re shooting large-caliber guns,” she said. “And it can go on for a long time, if you’re shooting for an hour or more. Kids get scared, pets get scared, and people are always afraid bullets are going to come flying onto their property. We’ve not had that happen, but I think this [discussion] is preventative.”</p>
<p>Still, many residents who spoke during the public comment portion of last week&#8217;s meeting voiced their opposition to new regulations or changes stemming from concerns over volume. Some said updated rules would lead them to cut back on time they spend shooting, which would affect their proficiency. Others offered how difficult it would be to enforce a noise ordinance.</p>
<p>Dwayne Mitchell was one of the residents who spoke. He said his family is likely one of the reasons Hatch Road residents approached the board in June. He lives on Council Lane and his family has a long history of shooting together, having built a big berm around a 10-acre lot. Mitchell said he and his brother regularly train their children in shooting, but they’ve already had to cut back to shooting just once a week because of complaints from neighbors.</p>
<p>“We do everything that we do in a safe manner,” said Mitchell. “I feel like if you don’t know the rules and regulations of Orange County before you move here, [our shooting] shouldn’t be an issue. We respect the issue of shooting, and so do our peers.”</p>
<p>Neal Galloway also is a shooter who voiced his feelings on the matter. An Orange County resident of 30 years, he said shooting is very important to him and his family. He said the two main considerations shooters should keep in mind around others are safety and courtesy.</p>
<p>“No law has told me not to shoot more than an hour-and-a-half and stop,” Galloway said, “but that’s what I do. There’s no law that says I can’t shoot on Sunday, but I don’t. There are courtesy factors that can be spread and made positive among shooters, and I hope shooters respect that. Those are things that can help everyone live with each other.”</p>
<p>Rich said she reached out to Galloway after the meeting to thank him for his comments but had failed to get in touch with him. She reiterated it’s still not official that the board will even create a density overlay or updated ordinances for Orange County neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“We’ve had input; we’ve talked to law enforcement; we’ve talked to our attorney,” Rich said. “We know what we can and cannot do. This is just the next step because, once again, folks are feeling threatened. When people are feeling unsafe, it’s the commissioners’ job to look at the issues and see what we can do about it.”</p>
<p>The Board of Orange County Commissioners work session will be at 7 p.m. on September 10 at the Southern Human Services Center.</p>

<p>Authorities said 46-year-old Anne H. Kirkpatrick, of 2509 Brown Road, was found dead around 1:30 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>The case is being investigated as a homicide, according to the sheriff’s office, but no other details were provided as to how Kirkpatrick was injured.</p>
<p>“The victim’s family has been notified, allowing us to make her name and address public,” Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood said in a release. “We understand the community’s desire to know more information; however, we are unable to provide additional details at this time. This is necessary to protect the integrity of the investigation.”</p>
<p>Anyone with additional information regarding any unusual activity Sunday morning in the area is asked to contact investigator Zach Baldwin with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office at (919) 245-2939.</p>

<p>Last week’s ruling by a three-judge panel gave state lawmakers two weeks to prepare new state legislative maps.</p>
<p>State Representative Graig Meyer, a House Democrat representing Orange and Caswell counties in the General Assembly, said the ruling on gerrymandering could represent a step a nonpartisan redistricting process.</p>
<p>“I think it makes it much more likely that we will end up with an independent, nonpartisan process for redistricting somewhere down the road,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although, we are not quite there yet with this ruling.”</p>
<p>This ruling happened <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/state-news/nc-redistricting-fight-turns-to-state-courts-after-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after an earlier decision in June by the U.S. Supreme Court</a> that determined federal courts should not weigh in on the constitutionality of political redistricting, even in extreme cases known as gerrymandering. State courts across the country, however, have taken on the question of how much partisan gerrymandering is too much.</p>
<p>NC Senate Leader Phil Berger told the Associated Press last week that his chamber would move forward adopting a “nonpartisan map” following the court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Representative Meyer said he was hopeful that this new attempt at drawing state legislative districts will lead to public awareness of the structural changes needed for the future.</p>
<p>“People will see how messy this process is and that you really do not want legislators drawing their own districts and picking their own voters for their election,&#8221; he told WCHL. &#8220;The farther we go down the legal course here, the more I think there will be public demand for doing it a better way that people believe is fair.”</p>

<p>Damage surveys and work to clean up the mess left behind by Hurricane Dorian were underway, said Hyde County spokesman Donnie Shumate. There was still no power or any sense of when it might be restored, he said.</p>
<p>While it was far too early to estimate the island&#8217;s total economic damages, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be catastrophic for sure,&#8221; Shumate said.</p>
<p>Gov. Roy Cooper has said about 800 people remained on the island to wait out Dorian, which made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks and swamped Ocracoke with floodwaters. Residents said the damage is the worst anyone alive has seen, although no deaths or serious injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Shumate said a staging area was set up at the fire station where residents could access necessities such as food, water and cleaning supplies. The Salvation Army was serving lunch and dinner Sunday at a community center, and the county said disaster counseling services would be available.</p>
<p>The county was still under a mandatory evacuation order, and no one but emergency responders and authorized personnel including supply crews were being allowed on ferries. Private boats attempting to access the island would be turned away, the county warned in a news release.</p>
<p>About 100 National Guard soldiers remained on Ocracoke supporting recovery operations, along with a medical team and emergency managers, Cooper&#8217;s office said in a news release Sunday.</p>
<p>The N.C. Department of Insurance was coordinating the arrival of insurance adjusters to help homeowners and businesses and will assist with a plan for disposing of the many flooded vehicles on the island, according to the release.</p>
<p>Ocracoke Island resident and restaurant owner Daphne Bennink told The Associated Press on Saturday that the flooding from Dorian impacted the majority of people and businesses on the island, from Ocracoke&#8217;s single public school to its one grocery store to entire homes.</p>
<p>She said repairs will likely take weeks if not months on some properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t just get electricity and go back to work,&#8221; said Bennink, who owns the Back Porch Restaurant and Wine Bar. &#8220;You have all this insulation and duct work that on most properties is going to have to get ripped out and redone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further north on the Outer Banks, which were subject to a mandatory evacuation order ahead of the storm&#8217;s arrival, officials in<span> </span><a href="https://www.darenc.com/Home/Components/News/News/5608/1465?fbclid=IwAR0mR5eSSiy7Rd6RtgInAMGLf3ZFwEPfTyNTTidA7n48L62jS_jYYI7eJys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dare</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://co.currituck.nc.us/?fbclid=IwAR34rYh0TBPyPUDf2ZLFri2-rrWpsBrwKJ_jgDRqWw02DoRtbad4AY_o1SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Currituck</a><span> </span>counties were staging re-entries for residents and visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not every area evacuated is safe to return to just yet,&#8221; Cooper said in a statement. &#8220;Those eager to return to the islands should follow the re-entry instructions issued by local governments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two deaths in North Carolina were blamed on the storm. One victim was a man who fell from a ladder while preparing for Dorian, and the other was a man who collapsed while cleaning debris at his home.</p>
<p>Dorian peeled away from the coastline after hitting North Carolina and went to sea as it moved up the Eastern Seaboard. On Sunday, downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, it was bringing hurricane-force winds to far-eastern Canada, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>By far the greatest devastation caused by the storm was in the Bahamas, where Dorian struck a week ago as a Category 5 hurricane, killing at least 44 people.</p>

<p>Gov. Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian. The storm made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than<span> </span><a href="https://apnews.com/b5170a22a8a14bc584c8d6c1a64825cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the monster</a><span> </span>that devastated the Bahamas. Yet despite having been downgraded to a Category 1 storm, it still sent seawater surging over neighborhoods, flooding the first floors of many homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is significant concern about hundreds of people trapped on Ocracoke Island,&#8221; Cooper said.</p>
<p>Harris lost his car to the storm and his air conditioning is damaged, but he said he&#8217;s blessed that his condominium is on the third floor and he is insured. Of the 11 units in his complex, seven had water in them, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a strange picture,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve been a regular guest down here for years, you can&#8217;t imagine what we saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard began landing local law enforcement officers on the island Friday via helicopter and airlifting out the sick, elderly and others in distress, Hyde County authorities said. National Guard helicopters also flew in supplies and a rescue team.</p>
<p>By Friday evening, the governor said that officials were aware of no serious injuries on the Outer Banks from the storm. People in need of temporary housing were being taken to a shelter on the mainland, the governor said.</p>
<p>Connie Leinbach, who publishes the Ocracoke Observer newspaper, said sheriff&#8217;s deputies and other rescue personnel performed at least two rescues from attics. She said the Coast Guard was also called in to help a man who was having problems with his oxygen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a ton of water here. It&#8217;s more than (Hurricane) Matthew,&#8221; Leinbach said, comparing it to the damaging 2016 storm.</p>
<p>Dorian is expected to remain a hurricane as it sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard through Saturday. While tropical-storm force winds<span> </span><a href="https://apnews.com/8abd08b36d6e4b91a289efda434db95b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are buffeting southeastern Massachusetts</a><span> </span>and could sweep into Maine later Saturday, hurricane-force winds are unlikely to pose any threat to land in the U.S.</p>
<p>Canadian officials are expecting Dorian to remain a Category 1 hurricane when it makes landfall in Nova Scotia later Saturday.</p>
<p>Canadian Hurricane Centre meteorologist Ian Hubbard said Saturday that storm is expected to lose its title as a hurricane as it crosses the province.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. hurricane center said that even if Dorian downgrades to a tropical storm, hurricane conditions are expected in portions of eastern Nova Scotia and western Newfoundland by late Saturday or early Sunday.</p>
<p>Hubbard said the last hurricanes to make landfall in Canada were Hurricane Igor and Hurricane Earl in September, 2010. Hurricanes in Canada are somewhat rare in part because once the storms reach colder Canadian waters, they lose their main source of energy.</p>
<p>At least four deaths in the Southeast were blamed on Dorian. All were men in Florida or North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.</p>
<p>As Dorian closed in, more than a quarter-million residents and visitors were ordered to evacuate the Outer Banks, which stick out from the Eastern Seaboard like the sideview mirror on a car. But many just tied down their boats, removed objects that could blow away from their yards, and hunkered down.</p>
<p>Dorian slammed<span> </span><a href="https://apnews.com/f585fe0d4b0545749a24908e7a59a85a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bahamas</a><span> </span>at the start of the week with 185 mph winds,<span> </span><a href="https://apnews.com/d7015705d0eb46ec847bf8e26053d9a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killing at least 43 people</a><span> </span>and obliterating countless homes. From there, it swept past Florida and Georgia, then sideswiped the Carolinas on Thursday, spinning off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>Still, the damage was far less than feared in many parts of the Carolinas, including historic Charleston, South Carolina, which is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms, and Wilmington, North Carolina, the state&#8217;s biggest coastal city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, it appears we&#8217;ve had no loss of life,&#8221; Harris said of Ocracoke. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make sure everybody is safe, but it&#8217;s going to be a long recovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Saturday, members of the public can donate electronic items to Kramden, which will then refurbish reusable items and recycle the rest. The institute will then distribute refurbished electronics to families in need, preventing the items from ending up in landfills.</p>
<p>The drop-off location for the electronics is in the University Place parking lot behind Silverspot Cinema off Willow Drive. Items will be taken from <span>8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and any donations are tax deductible. Acceptable electronics include desktop computers, laptops, cellphones, tablets and servers. They&#8217;ll also take </span><span>mice, keyboards, hard drives, RAM, flash drives, power cords and more.</span></p>
<p><span>The institute requests people to not bring printers, scanners, stereo speakers or household appliances.</span></p>
<p>The Kramden Institute is a tech non-profit based out of Durham. Since being created in 2003, the organization has given more than 30,000 computers to students and provided education programs to more than 3,000 people. They have donated electronics to people in 81 of North Carolina&#8217;s 100 counties.</p>

<p>Police responded to the school just after 12:15 p.m. Thursday “due to a report of a subject wearing a mask and possibly carrying a firearm” near the school, authorities said on Friday.</p>
<p>The dispatch corresponded with students being dismissed early as the school district closed three hours early Thursday because of the impending threat from Hurricane Dorian.</p>
<p>Authorities said Friday that the school was placed on lockdown while the investigation was carried out. Police found the individual who was the cause of concern and determined “the individual had been removing personal belongings from a vehicle and put the mask on rather than carrying it.”</p>
<p>“There was no firearm involved,” police added, “and it was determined that there was no threat to the school or neighborhood at any time.”</p>
<p>Parents expressed concern over a lack of notification regarding the lockdown.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have been told there was a brief lockdown due to a report of a suspicious person near the school. Police investigated and found nothing in the area, according to district officials, and the lockdown was lifted.</p>

<p>“If there was an active threat, school system and Town of Chapel Hill communication channels would be utilized to inform parents and people in the community of actions needed to be taken,” law enforcement officials said Friday.</p>
<p>Officers did remain on the scene to assist with student release following the lockdown due to traffic congestion at the scene.</p>
<p>Schools were also delayed on Friday as the hurricane threatened central North Carolina overnight Thursday into Friday.</p>

<p>Its winds down to 90 mph, the Category 1 hurricane lashed communities with rain and surging seawater as it hugged the islands. Around midmorning, its eye came ashore at Cape Hatteras, Dorian&#8217;s first landfall on the U.S. mainland.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad,&#8221; Ann Warner, who owns Howard&#8217;s Pub on Ocracoke Island, said by telephone. &#8220;The water came up to the inside of our bottom floor, which has never had water.&#8221; She said a skylight blew out and whitecaps coursed through her front yard and underneath her elevated house.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re safe,&#8221; Warner added. &#8220;But it&#8217;s certainly a mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another Ocracoke Island resident, bookshop owner Leslie Lanier, said via text message that the first floors of some homes had flooded and people had been forced to retreat to their attics, but that the water had already begun to drop.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are flooding like crazy,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;I have been here 32 years and not seen this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hyde County Sheriff&#8217;s Office said deputies, medics and other rescuers were heading to the island amid reports of &#8220;catastrophic flooding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is significant concern about hundreds of people trapped on Ocracoke Island,&#8221; Gov. Roy Cooper said. &#8220;There are rescue teams ready as soon as they can get in.&#8221; He said that the water was rising fast and that authorities were telling people to get to the highest point in their homes.</p>
<p>Even in good weather, the island is reachable only by boat or air.</p>
<p>As of 9 a.m. EDT, Dorian was moving northeast at 14 mph. It is expected to remain a hurricane as it sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard through Saturday, veering far enough offshore that its hurricane-force winds are unlikely to pose any threat to land in the U.S.</p>
<p>More than 370,000 people were without electricity in the Carolinas and Virginia as Dorian moved up the coast.</p>
<p>At least four people were killed in the Southeast. All were men in Florida or North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.</p>
<p>On the Outer Banks, which stick out from the coast like the side-view mirror on a car, forecasters said large and destructive waves could reach nearly to the ceilings of one-story structures along the 200-mile string of islands.</p>
<p>As Dorian closed in, many of the Outer Banks&#8217; storm-hardened residents tied down their boats, removed objects from their yards that could blow away, and hunkered down. Warner said about half the 1,000 residents of Ocracoke stuck it out.</p>
<p>At the start of the week, Dorian slammed the Bahamas with 185 mph winds, killing at least 30 people and obliterating countless homes. From there, it swept past Florida and Georgia at a relatively safe distance, then sideswiped the Carolinas on Thursday, spinning off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>Still, the damage was far less than feared in many parts of the Carolinas, including historic Charleston, South Carolina, which is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms, and Wilmington, North Carolina, the state&#8217;s biggest coastal city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We prepared for the worst and that didn&#8217;t happen. That&#8217;s OK. I was a little worried back when it was a Category 3. We got lucky,&#8221; said Ross Page, who walked his dogs in Wilmington on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Joseph Pawlick went out to rake leaves, twigs and other debris blown from the sidewalk outside his Wilmington home. &#8220;I slept like a baby last night. This, thankfully, was not bad,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Office announced 58-year-old Teresa Mosser turned herself in on Thursday on first-degree murder charges after her husband, James Charles Mosser, was shot and killed in 2018.</p>
<p>Mosser called 911 on April 25, 2018, reporting that she shot at her husband on Eno Cemetary Road in Cedar Grove but did not know if she hit him, according to law enforcement. She placed the call from another room at the residence where she ran after firing the gun. Mosser told responding deputies that she fired the gun in self-defense.</p>
<p>Deputies had responded to another domestic call at the residence a month prior, according to the sheriff&#8217;s office, but the situation was verbal only.</p>
<p>After an investigation &#8212; which included a crime scene reenactment &#8212; authorities sought a warrant for first-degree murder on Wednesday. Mosser turned herself in on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mosser was released from custody on a $50,000 secured bond and made an initial appearance in court. She is scheduled to next appear in court on September 23.</p>

					The Orange County Board of Commissioners passed a pair of resolutions on Tuesday that aimed to promote inclusivity in the community and understanding of black Americans’ struggles.</p>
<p>Following the<a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/local-government/hillsborough-march-to-promote-hate-free-community-spurn-kkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> presence of Ku Klux Klan members in Hillsborough</a> two weeks ago, the commissioners passed a resolution condemning the actions of hate groups and rejecting white supremacy.</p>
<p>Chair of the Board of Commissioners Penny Rich read the resolution she drafted with help from Caswell County commissioner Sterling Carter; the KKK group that came to Hillsborough is one of the largest and most active chapters in the country and is based in Pelham, which is in Caswell County.</p>
<p>“Now therefore be it resolved that we,” Rich said, “the Orange County Board of Commissioners, strongly oppose the activities of the Ku Klux Klan, reject white nationalist, white supremacist, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups, and urge lawmakers in the state of North Carolina and the federal government to denounce threats posed by those groups.”</p>
<p>In response to the KKK’s demonstration, community members<a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/safety/energetic-turnout-at-hillsborough-march-opposing-recent-white-supremacist-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> held a march against hate</a> in downtown Hillsborough the following Saturday. Latarndra Strong was the main organizer of the event. She said the county’s communities of color are “terrified” after the events of the last few weeks. Before the commissioners’ vote, Strong commended the proclamation but urged the board to go further.</p>
<p>“I think you have a responsibility, as leaders of this community, to stop the nonsense about free speech [as a defense] when we have violent organizations recruiting in our community,” Strong said. “This is not about free speech.”</p>
<p>The board also passed a proclamation to acknowledge the 400-year anniversary of &#8220;unfree Africans&#8221; arriving in North America. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2019/07-08/virginia-first-africans-transatlantic-slave-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Historical records from 1619</a> show the arrival of several Africans to the Virginia settlement and their sale, beginning the country’s history of slavery.</p>
<p>The proclamation commemorates the next 11 months as a year of remembrance and serves as a stamp of approval to events planned for honoring and examining the history of African Americans in the county.</p>
<p>Annette Moore, the county&#8217;s Human Rights and Relations director, spoke to the commissioners before their vote. She said the board’s acknowledgement would help educate people on what she called America’s greatest challenge.</p>
<p>“Slavery has been part of America much longer than it hasn’t,” said Moore. “A century and a half after slavery was made illegal, we still see the trauma of this infectious disease.”</p>
<p>President of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro chapter of the NAACP Anna Richards also spoke to the commissioners. She said she believes the proclamation will support the idea of more dialogue about the country’s history and will serve as a sign against mentalities she described as “appalling.”</p>
<p>“We need to understand our history lest we repeat it,” Richards said. “Shockingly, to me, I see things today that I thought I would never see in my lifetime and things I thought my children would never have to.”</p>
<p>Both measures fall under the board’s self-imposed social justice goal of rejecting oppression and inequity. Both items passed unanimously.

<p>Senate leader Phil Berger said after the ruling his chamber would move forward adopting a &#8220;nonpartisan map.&#8221; House Speaker Tim Moore&#8217;s office had no comment.</p>
<p>The judges on Tuesday found nearly 80 House and Senate districts violated the state constitution because Republicans manipulated lines to make it nearly impossible for Democrats to win majorities. The judges gave lawmakers until Sept. 18 to enact districts.</p>

<p>The Orange County Sheriff’s Office and Orange County Schools issued a joint release about the incident on Wednesday afternoon saying that the school was never put on lockdown and the situation did not interfere with the regular school day.</p>
<p>Officials said Christopher Hill and his girlfriend arrived at New Hope Elementary on Wednesday morning to drop off children for school.</p>
<p>“Both parties signed in at the kiosk in the front office, as is standard procedure when a parent or community member plans to remain on campus once school begins,” according to Wednesday’s release.</p>
<p>The kiosk printed visitor passes for each individual.</p>

<p>Hill then began walking down a hall of classrooms, according to law enforcement, while wearing tan tactical pants, a black polo shirt and a black vest, “all similar to the attire of an OCSO deputy sheriff.”</p>
<p>The vest had the word SHERIFF patched onto the back and had another logo patch on the front “not associated in any way with law enforcement.”</p>
<p>An assistant principal noticed Hill and notified the principal and School Resource Officer. Two teachers then told the SRO that Hill “told them he was providing volunteer security.” Hill was not carrying any weapons or police gear, including handcuffs or a radio.</p>
<p>Hill complied with the principal once he was located in the school and went to the administrative office. Authorities then placed him under arrest once he was off school grounds and out of view of students and staff, law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood said that Wednesday’s response and arrest came as a result of collaborative training efforts.</p>
<p>“School administration and the SRO responded quickly, acted decisively, arranged for additional resources, and made the arrest without any undue fanfare that might be alarming to elementary students,” Blackwood said in a release. “I happen to know how hard Principal Ambra Wilson and SRO Sparrow have worked day in and day out for the last several years to build trust within the New Hope School community. Today, someone threatened to undermine that trust by impersonating a law enforcement officer. Wilson and Sparrow shut that situation down immediately.”</p>
<p>Wilson added that a safe learning environment is critical “so that our students and teachers can thrive in an amazing environment.”</p>
<p>Hill is being held in the Orange County jail under a $500,000 bond and is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Thursday.</p>

<p>Last year, Hurricane Florence dropped more than 8 inches of rain <a href="https://chapelboro.com/town-square/9-17-18-orange-county-flooding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our area</a> over the course of five days in September.</p>
<p>Flooding in Chapel Hill from Florence closed local schools and <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/weather/rain-from-hurricane-florence-causes-flooding-road-closures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sections of major roadways</a> like MLK Boulevard, Fordham Boulevard and portions of Estes Drive. Statewide, damages were estimated to cost more than $20 billion.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger says the town has been working in preparation of hurricane season, cleaning out storm drains and improving communication between agencies.</p>
<p>“When you are running a business, the last thing you want to worry about is flooding your store. Because it’s a lot of damage to get repaired, and you have to get people in to do that. You’re shut down, so you are not earning income and doing the repairs. We don’t want people to have to do that, but we are here to help if that happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>The state judges found that the way the majority-Republican General Assembly redrew legislative district maps in 2017 violated the rights of Democratic voters under the state constitution&#8217;s equal protection and freedom of assembly clauses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partisan intent predominated over all other redistricting criteria resulting in extreme partisan gerrymandered legislative maps,&#8221; the judges wrote. &#8220;The effect of these carefully crafted partisan maps is that, in all but the most unusual election scenarios, the Republican Party will control a majority of both chambers of the General Assembly. In other words, the court finds that in many election environments, it is the carefully crafted maps, and not the will of the voters, that dictate the election outcomes in a significant number of legislative districts and, ultimately, the majority control of the General Assembly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. David Lewis, a chief defendant in the case, declined to comment. Senate leader Phil Berger said senators would follow the court&#8217;s instructions and adopt &#8220;a nonpartisan map,&#8221; but his prepared statement didn&#8217;t explicitly rule out a possible appeal.</p>
<p>The court gave lawmakers until Sept. 18 to again redraw maps to be used in next year&#8217;s elections. The judges said they would appoint an outside referee to advise them in next steps, including drawing maps if lawmakers miss their Sept. 18 deadline.</p>
<p>The judges also raised the possibility they would postpone the state&#8217;s March primary for legislature or other offices if they feel it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<p>Redistricting is the process of redrawing voting districts for state legislatures and Congress after every decennial census. Gerrymandering describes when the redistricting is slanted to give one political party a majority in as many districts as possible. North Carolina&#8217;s legislative districts were redrawn in 2017 after a federal court determined they were an illegal gerrymander that sought to weaken the voting strength of minority voters.</p>
<p>But the group Common Cause and more than 30 registered Democratic voters sued, saying the 2017 districts were still so gerrymandered they unconstitutionally insulated Republicans from changes in voting behavior.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Republican state legislators argued there was no clear way for judges to know what kinds of map-making are unacceptable, since &#8220;redistricting is political because of what it is, not because of who does it.&#8221; Any complaints about how districts were drawn would vanish if Democrats could lead some GOP voters to change their minds and voted with them, GOP lawyers said.</p>
<p>If state courts ultimately rule in favor of Democrats, they could order new district maps for next year&#8217;s legislative elections. Lawmakers winning those elections will draw up maps after the 2020 census to last for the following decade, again influencing political power in the country&#8217;s ninth-largest state.</p>
<p>The lawsuit contended that most of the 170 House and Senate districts drawn in 2017 violated the plaintiffs&#8217; free speech and association protections under the state constitution. It also said the boundaries violated a constitutional provision stating &#8220;all elections shall be free,&#8221; because the maps are rigged to predetermine electoral outcomes and virtually ensure Republican control of the legislature.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel agreed Tuesday that part of the state constitution was violated.</p>
<p>The ruling appears to meet the request of plaintiffs by ordering that nearly half of state House districts and 21 of 50 Senate maps redrawn quickly, Common Cause NC spokesman Bryan Warner said.</p>
<p>The judges also imposed rules on a new round of redistricting. The new mapmaking must start from scratch, all map-drawing must occur at public hearings with computer screens visible to everyone and any consultants hired by lawmakers must be approved by the court.</p>
<p>Evidence introduced during the two-week trial in July included computer records created by Tom Hofeller, a now-dead GOP redistricting guru who helped draw the 2017 legislative maps. Those files, collected by Hofeller&#8217;s estranged daughter after his death and shared with Common Cause, showed that Republican advantage was the overall objective of the latest redistricting.</p>
<p>Some of Hofeller&#8217;s files were also used in separate litigation in New York challenging a plan by President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration to include a citizenship question on the 2020 U.S. census.</p>
<p>The North Carolina lawsuit marks at least the eighth legal action challenging state election district maps since the current round of redistricting began in 2011. The lawsuits resulted in redrawing congressional lines in 2016 and legislative districts in 2017 — both to address racial bias.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials in Hillsborough are now looking for information regarding the flyers, including where they were found across the town.</p>
<p>Saturday’s rally came one week after members of the Ku Klux Klan held a brief demonstration in downtown Hillsborough, which has been the site of multiple rallies in recent weeks. Instances of individuals standing on downtown sidewalks waving Confederate flags drew the attention of locals who <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/safety/groups-protest-gun-violence-white-nationalist-terrorism-at-hillsborough-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organized a rally against gun violence and white nationalist terrorism</a> last month.</p>
<p>Orange County authorities have <a href="https://chapelboro.com/news/crime/warrants-taken-against-2-at-weekend-kkk-rally-in-hillsborough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken out arrest warrants against two individuals</a> connected to the KKK demonstration in Hillsborough for allegedly carrying firearms at the demonstration. Authorities said following the event that law enforcement officers did not see the firearms during the event but were made aware following the rally. Officials reviewed evidence from the scene before issuing the arrest warrants two days later.</p>
<p>“We stand in solidarity with Hillsborough residents, businesses, and neighbors in keeping our community safe for everybody and in making this town a place where intimidation, bullying, and expressions of hate have no place,” Mayor Tom Stevens said in a release from the town.</p>
<p>Officials are asking residents to avoid posting images of the flyer “to avoid additional advertising of the sender’s message.”</p>
<p>Police are asking that anyone who received a flyer or has information regarding the distribution of the flyers contact Sergeant Nick Chelenza at (919) 296-9552 or by <a href="https://www.hillsboroughnc.gov/government/contact-us/send-email/police-patrol-division/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email</a>.</p>
